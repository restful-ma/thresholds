  description: The Local Search client lets you send a search query to Bing and get back
    search results that include local businesses such as restaurants, hotels,
    retail stores, or other local businesses. The query can specify the name of
    the local business or it can ask for a list (for example, restaurants near
    me).

            This header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive;
            do not specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify
            the cc query parameter. Bing will use the first supported language
            it finds from the list, and combine that language with the cc
            parameter value to determine the market to return results for. If
            the list does not include a supported language, Bing will find the
            closest language and market that supports the request, and may use
            an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a
            specified one. You should use this header and the cc query parameter
            only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use
            the mkt and setLang query parameters. A user interface string is a
            string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are very
            few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Any links
            in the response objects to Bing.com properties will apply the
            specified language.

            browser would send. For information about user agents, see [RFC

        - description: "Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior
            across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features and
            improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
            traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID
            for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user
            to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple
            conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For
            example, if the second request has a different flight assignment
            than the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use
            the client ID to tailor web results to that client IDâ€™s search
            history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses
            this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
            activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help
            with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn
            enables higher click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT:
            Although optional, you should consider this header required.
            Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same end
            user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
            consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via
            better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses
            your application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated
            client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
            generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response
            header. The only time that you should NOT include this header in a
            request is the first time the user uses your app on that device. Use
            the client ID for each Bing API request that your app makes for this
            user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID in a
            browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps
            such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist
            the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
            client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include
            this header. If the response includes this header, capture the
            client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user
            on that device. If you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not
            include cookies in the request."

            X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example,
            by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in
            the location not being anywhere near the device's actual location,
            which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.

            latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or
            equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and
            positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The
            longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must
            be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0.
            Negative values indicate western longitudes and positive values
            indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters,
            which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
            value returned by the device's location service. Typical values
            might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and
            18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp
            of when the client was at the location. (The UNIX timestamp is the
            number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The
            client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify the
            direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting
            clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
            key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in
            meters per second, that the client device is traveling. alt

            (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical
            accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify
            the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more
            information that you provide, the more accurate the location results
            are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the
            user's geographical location. Providing the location is especially
            important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the
            user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
            optimal results, you should include this header and the

      summary: The Local Search API lets you send a search query to Bing and get back
        search results that include local businesses such as restaurants,
        hotels, retail stores, or other local businesses. The query can specify
        the name of the local business or it can ask for a list (for example,
        restaurants near me).
