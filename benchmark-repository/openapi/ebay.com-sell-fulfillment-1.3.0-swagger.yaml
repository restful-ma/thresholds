        their creation date, last modification date, or fulfillment status using
        the filter parameter. You can alternatively specify a list of orders
        using the orderIds parameter. The returned Order objects contain
        information you can use to create and process fulfillments, including:
        Information about the buyer and seller Information about the order's
        line items The plans for packaging, addressing and shipping the order
        The status of payment, packaging, addressing, and shipping the order A
        summary of monetary amounts specific to the order such as pricing,
        payments, and shipping costs Important: In this call, the

        the getOrder call instead, which returns this array fully populated with
        information about any cancellation requests."

      parameters:
        - description: "One or more comma-separated criteria for narrowing down the
            collection of orders returned by this call. These criteria
            correspond to specific fields in the response payload. Multiple
            filter criteria combine to further restrict the results. Note:
            Currently, filter returns data from only the last 90 days. If the
            orderIds parameter is included in the request, the filter parameter
            will be ignored.The available criteria are as follows: creationdate
            The time period during which qualifying orders were created (the
            orders.creationDate field). In the URI, this is expressed as a
            starting timestamp, with or without an ending timestamp (in
            brackets). The timestamps are in ISO 8601 format, which uses the
            24-hour Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) clock.For example:
            creationdate:[2016-02-21T08:25:43.511Z..] identifies orders created
            on or after the given timestamp.
            creationdate:[2016-02-21T08:25:43.511Z..2016-04-21T08:25:43.511Z]
            identifies orders created between the given timestamps, inclusive.
            lastmodifieddate The time period during which qualifying orders were
            last modified (the orders.modifiedDate field). In the URI, this is
            expressed as a starting timestamp, with or without an ending
            timestamp (in brackets). The timestamps are in ISO 8601 format,
            which uses the 24-hour Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) clock.For
            example: lastmodifieddate:[2016-05-15T08:25:43.511Z..] identifies
            orders modified on or after the given timestamp.
            lastmodifieddate:[2016-05-15T08:25:43.511Z..2016-05-31T08:25:43.511\
            Z] identifies orders modified between the given timestamps,
            inclusive.Note: If creationdate and lastmodifieddate are both
            included, only creationdate is used. orderfulfillmentstatus The
            degree to which qualifying orders have been shipped (the
            orders.orderFulfillmentStatus field). In the URI, this is expressed
            as one of the following value combinations:
            orderfulfillmentstatus:{NOT_STARTED|IN_PROGRESS} specifies orders
            for which no shipping fulfillments have been started, plus orders
            for which at least one shipping fulfillment has been started but not
            completed. orderfulfillmentstatus:{FULFILLED|IN_PROGRESS} specifies
            orders for which all shipping fulfillments have been completed, plus
            orders for which at least one shipping fulfillment has been started
            but not completed.Note: The values NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, and
            FULFILLED can be used in various combinations, but only the
            combinations shown here are currently supported.Here is an example
            of a getOrders call using all of these filters: GET
            https://api.ebay.com/sell/v1/order?
            filter=creationdate:%5B2016-03-21T08:25:43.511Z..2016-04-21T08:25:4\
            3.511Z%5D, lastmodifieddate:%5B2016-05-15T08:25:43.511Z..%5D,
            orderfulfillmentstatus:%7BNOT_STARTED%7CIN_PROGRESS%7D Note: This
            call requires that certain special characters in the URI query
            string be percent-encoded: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ = %5B
