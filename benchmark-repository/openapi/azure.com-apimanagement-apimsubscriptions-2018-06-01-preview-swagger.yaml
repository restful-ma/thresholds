  description: Use these REST APIs for performing operations on Subscription entity
    associated with your Azure API Management deployment. The Subscription
    entity represents the association between a user and a product in API
    Management. Products contain one or more APIs, and once a product is
    published, developers can subscribe to the product and begin to use the
    productâ€™s APIs.
