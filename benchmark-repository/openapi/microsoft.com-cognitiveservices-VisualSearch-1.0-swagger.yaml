    similar images, shopping sources, and related searches. The API can also
    perform text recognition, identify entities (people, places, things), return
    other topical content for the user to explore, and more. For more

            uses the first supported language it finds from the list and
            combines it with the cc parameter value. If the list does not
            include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and
            market that supports the request or it uses an aggregated or default
            market for the results. To determine the market that Bing used, see
            the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc query
            parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
            [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-visual-search-api-v7-reference#mkt)

        - description: "Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior
            across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features and
            improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
            traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID
            for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user
            to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple
            conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For
            example, if the second request has a different flight assignment
            than the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use
            the client ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search
            history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses
            this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
            activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help
            with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn
            enables higher click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT:
            Although optional, you should consider this header required.
            Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same end
            user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
            consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via
            better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses
            your application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated
            client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
            generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response
            header. The only time that you should NOT include this header in a
            request is the first time the user uses your app on that device. Use
            the client ID for each Bing API request that your app makes for this
            user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID in a
            browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps
            such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist
            the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
            client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include
            this header. If the response includes this header, capture the
            client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user
            on that device. ATTENTION: You must ensure that this Client ID is
            not linkable to any authenticatable user account information. If you
            include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the
            request."

            you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
            X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example,
            by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in
            the location not being anywhere near the device's actual location,
            which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.

            latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or
            equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and

            be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0.
            Negative values indicate western longitudes and positive values

            value returned by the device's location service. Typical values
            might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and
            18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp
            of when the client was at the location. (The UNIX timestamp is the
            number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The
            client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify the
            direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting
            clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp

            accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify
            the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more
            information that you provide, the more accurate the location results
            are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the
            user's geographical location. Providing the location is especially
            important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the
            user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
            optimal results, you should include this header and the

      summary: Visual Search API lets you discover insights about an image such as
        visually similar images, shopping sources, and related searches. The API
        can also perform text recognition, identify entities (people, places,
        things), return other topical content for the user to explore, and more.
