        For clusters that have the Repair Manager Service configured,

        this API provides a way to create repair tasks that run automatically or manually.

        For repair tasks that run automatically, an appropriate repair executor

        must be running for each repair action to run automatically.

        These are currently only available in specially-configured Azure Cloud Services.


        To create a manual repair task, provide the set of impacted node names and the

        expected impact. When the state of the created repair task changes to approved,

        you can safely perform repair actions on those nodes.

        The following is a list of APIs that start fault operations that may be
        cancelled using CancelOperation -

        - StartDataLoss

        - StartQuorumLoss

        - StartPartitionRestart

        - StartNodeTransition


        If force is false, then the specified user-induced operation will be gracefully stopped and cleaned up.  If force is true, the command will be aborted, and some internal state

        may be left behind.  Specifying force as true should be used with care.  Calling this API with force set to true is not allowed until this API has already

        been called on the same test command with force set to false first, or unless the test command already has an OperationState of OperationState.RollingBack.

        Clarification: OperationState.RollingBack means that the system will/is be cleaning up internal system state caused by executing the command.  It will not restore data if the

        test command was to cause data loss.  For example, if you call StartDataLoss then call this API, the system will only clean up internal state from running the command.

        It will not restore the target partition's data, if the command progressed far enough to cause data loss.


        Important note:  if this API is invoked with force==true, internal state may be left behind.

        If Chaos is not already running in the cluster, it starts Chaos with the
        passed in Chaos parameters.

        If Chaos is already running when this call is made, the call fails with the error code FABRIC_E_CHAOS_ALREADY_RUNNING.

        Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.


        Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.

    ImmediateOptionalQueryParam:
      description: >
        A flag which indicates whether the report should be sent immediately.

        A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store.

        If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from Http Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the Http Gateway Application is using.

        This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible.

        Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the Http Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway.

        If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the Http Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration.

        This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing.

        By default, reports are not sent immediately.

        The application type health policy map can be used during cluster health evaluation to describe special application types.

        The application types included in the map are evaluated against the percentage specified in the map, and not with the global MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications defined in the cluster health policy.

        The applications of application types specified in the map are not counted against the global pool of applications.

        For example, if some applications of a type are critical, the cluster administrator can add an entry to the map for that application type

        and assign it a value of 0% (that is, do not tolerate any failures).

        All other applications can be evaluated with MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications set to 20% to tolerate some failures out of the thousands of application instances.

        The application type health policy map is used only if the cluster manifest enables application type health evaluation using the configuration entry for HealthManager/EnableApplicationTypeHealthEvaluation.

        specification. NodeTypeInclusionList and ApplicationInclusionList allow a union semantics only. It is not possible to specify an intersection

        of NodeTypeInclusionList and ApplicationInclusionList. For example, it is not possible to specify "fault this application only when it is on that node type."

        Once an entity is included in either NodeTypeInclusionList or ApplicationInclusionList, that entity cannot be excluded using ChaosTargetFilter. Even if

        applicationX does not appear in ApplicationInclusionList, in some Chaos iteration applicationX can be faulted because it happens to be on a node of nodeTypeY that is included

        in NodeTypeInclusionList. If both NodeTypeInclusionList and ApplicationInclusionList are null or empty, an ArgumentException is thrown.
      properties:

            All replicas belonging to services of these applications are amenable to replica faults (restart replica, remove replica, move primary, and move secondary) by Chaos.

            Chaos may restart a code package only if the code package hosts replicas of these applications only.

            If an application does not appear in this list, it can still be faulted in some Chaos iteration if the application ends up on a node of a node type that is included in NodeTypeInclusionList.

            However if applicationX is tied to nodeTypeY through placement constraints and applicationX is absent from ApplicationInclusionList and nodeTypeY is absent from NodeTypeInclusionList, then applicationX will never be faulted.

            At most 1000 application names can be included in this list, to increase this number, a config upgrade is required for MaxNumberOfApplicationsInChaosEntityFilter configuration.

            NodeTypeX, but code package and replica faults can still be enabled for NodeTypeX if an application in the ApplicationInclusionList.

            an error. For example, to allow 10% of nodes to be unhealthy, this
            value would be 10.


            The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of nodes that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.

            If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy node, the health is evaluated as Warning.

            The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy nodes over the total number of nodes in the cluster.

            The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of nodes. Default percentage is zero.


            In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so this percentage should be configured to tolerate that.

            When truncated, the last characters of the description contain a marker "[Truncated]", and total string size is 4096 characters.

        Property:
          description: >
            The property of the health information. An entity can have health
            reports for different properties.

            The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report.

            For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the state of the available disk on a node,

            so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node.

            The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a property "Connectivity" on the same node.

            In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the specified node.


            Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health information.

        RemoveWhenExpired:
          description: >
            Value that indicates whether the report is removed from health store
            when it expires.

            If set to true, the report is removed from the health store after it expires.

            If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value of this property is false by default.

            When clients report periodically, they should set RemoveWhenExpired false (default).

            This way, is the reporter has issues (eg. deadlock) and can't report, the entity is evaluated at error when the health report expires.

            This flags the entity as being in Error health state.

            When clients report periodically, they should send reports with higher frequency than time to live.

            If clients report on transition, they can set the time to live to infinite.

            When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health information

            is either removed from health store, if RemoveWhenExpired is true, or evaluated at error, if RemoveWhenExpired false.


            If not specified, time to live defaults to infinite value.

            The possible values are integer value of one of the following health states. Only nodes that match the filter are returned. All nodes are used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health state.

            If not specified, default value is None, unless the node name is specified. If the filter has default value and node name is specified, the matching node is returned.

            The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.

            For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches nodes with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).


            - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

            - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

            - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.

            - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.

            - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.

            If the node exists, it is included in the cluster health chunk if the health state matches the other filter properties.

            If not specified, all nodes that match the parent filters (if any) are taken into consideration and matched against the other filter members, like health state filter.

    PartitionHealthStateFilter:

        The partitions are only returned if the parent entities match a filter specified in the cluster health chunk query description. The parent service and application must be included in the cluster health chunk.

        One filter can match zero, one or multiple partitions, depending on its properties.

          description: >
            The filter for the health state of the partitions. It allows
            selecting partitions if they match the desired health states.

            The possible values are integer value of one of the following health states. Only partitions that match the filter are returned. All partitions are used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health state.

            If not specified, default value is None, unless the partition id is specified. If the filter has default value and partition id is specified, the matching partition is returned.

            The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.

            For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches partitions with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).


            - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

            - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

            - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.

            - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.

            - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.

            - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.

            If the partition doesn't exist, no partition is returned in the cluster health chunk based on this filter.

            If the partition exists, it is included in the cluster health chunk if it respects the other filter properties.

            If not specified, all partitions that match the parent filters (if any) are taken into consideration and matched against the other filter members, like health state filter.

            partition. The replicas are returned only if the parent partition
            matches a filter.

            If the list is empty, no replicas are returned. All the replicas are used to evaluate the parent partition aggregated health state, regardless of the input filters.

            The partition filter may specify multiple replica filters.

            For example, it can specify a filter to return all replicas with health state Error and another filter to always include a replica identified by its replica id.

            replicas if they match the desired health states.

            The possible values are integer value of one of the following health states. Only replicas that match the filter are returned. All replicas are used to evaluate the parent partition aggregated health state.

            If not specified, default value is None, unless the replica id is specified. If the filter has default value and replica id is specified, the matching replica is returned.

            The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.

            For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches replicas with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).


            - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

            - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

            - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.

            - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.

            For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches services with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).


            - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

            - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

            - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.

            - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.

            - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.

            - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.

            matches a filter.

            If the list is empty, no partitions are returned. All the partitions are used to evaluate the parent service aggregated health state, regardless of the input filters.

            The service filter may specify multiple partition filters.

            For example, it can specify a filter to return all partitions with health state Error and another filter to always include a partition identified by its partition id.

        This placement policy is usually used with fault domains in scenarios where the Service Fabric cluster is geographically distributed in order to indicate that a service�s primary replica should be located in a particular fault domain, which in geo-distributed scenarios usually aligns with regional or datacenter boundaries. Note that since this is an optimization it is possible that the Primary replica may not end up located in this domain due to failures, capacity limits, or other constraints.

        While this is not common it can expose the service to an increased risk of concurrent failures due to unplanned outages or other cases of subsequent/concurrent failures. As an example, consider a case where replicas are deployed across different data center, with one replica per location. In the event that one of the datacenters goes offline, normally the replica that was placed in that datacenter will be packed into one of the remaining datacenters. If this is not desirable then this policy should be set.

            Allowed values are Byte values from zero to 100


            The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of partitions that can be unhealthy before the service is considered in error.

            If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy partition, the health is evaluated as Warning.

            The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy partitions over the total number of partitions in the service.

            The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of partitions. Default percentage is zero.

            The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy replicas over the total number of replicas in the partition.

            The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of services that can be unhealthy before the application is considered in error.

            If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy service, the health is evaluated as Warning.

            This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy services of the specific service type over the total number of services of the specific service type.

        The entries in the map replace the default service type health policy for each specified service type. For example, in an application that contains both a stateless gateway service type and a stateful engine service type, the health policies for the stateless and stateful services can be configured differently. With policy per service type, there's more granular control of the health of the service.


        If no policy is specified for a service type name, the DefaultServiceTypeHealthPolicy is used for evaluation.
