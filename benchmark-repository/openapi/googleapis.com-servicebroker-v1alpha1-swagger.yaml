    GoogleIamV1__Policy:
      description: >-
        Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to

        specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.



        A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more

        `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,

        Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of

        permissions (defined by IAM or configured by users). A `binding` can

        optionally specify a `condition`, which is a logic expression that further

        constrains the role binding based on attributes about the request and/or

        target resource.


        **JSON Example**

            {
              "bindings": [
                {
                  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",
                  "members": [
                    "user:mike@example.com",
                    "group:admins@example.com",
                    "domain:google.com",
                    "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
                  ]
                },
                {
                  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer",
                  "members": ["user:eve@example.com"],
                  "condition": {
                    "title": "expirable access",
                    "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020",
                    "expression": "request.time <
                    timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')",
                  }
                }
              ]
            }

        **YAML Example**

            bindings:
            - members:
              - user:mike@example.com
              - group:admins@example.com
              - domain:google.com
              - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
              role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin
            - members:
              - user:eve@example.com
              role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
              condition:
                title: expirable access

            Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally may specify a
            `condition` that determines when binding is in effect.
            `bindings` with no members will result in an error.

        etag:
          description: >-
            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help

            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.

            It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the

            read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race

            conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and

            systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to

            ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.


            If no `etag` is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, then the existing

            policy is overwritten. Due to blind-set semantics of an etag-less policy,

            'setIamPolicy' will not fail even if either of incoming or stored policy

            does not meet the version requirements.
          format: byte
          type: string
        version:
          description: >-
            Specifies the format of the policy.


            Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be

            rejected.


            Operations affecting conditional bindings must specify version 3. This can

            be either setting a conditional policy, modifying a conditional binding,

            or removing a conditional binding from the stored conditional policy.

            Operations on non-conditional policies may specify any valid value or

            leave the field unset.


            If no etag is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, any version

            compliance checks on the incoming and/or stored policy is skipped.
