    The Verify API helps you to implement 2FA (two-factor authentication) in
    your applications. This is useful for:


    * Protecting against spam, by preventing spammers from creating multiple accounts

    * Monitoring suspicious activity, by forcing an account user to verify ownership of a number

    * Ensuring that you can reach your users at any time because you have their correct phone number

        Use Verify check to confirm that the PIN you received from your user
        matches the one sent by Nexmo in your Verify request.


        1. Send the verification `code` that your user supplied, with the corresponding `request_id` from the Verify request.

        2. Check the `status` of the response to determine if the code the user supplied matches the one sent by Nexmo.
