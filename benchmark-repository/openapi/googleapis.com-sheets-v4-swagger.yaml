    get:

        Returns the spreadsheet at the given ID.

        The caller must specify the spreadsheet ID.


        By default, data within grids will not be returned.

        You can include grid data one of two ways:


        * Specify a field mask listing your desired fields using the `fields` URL

        parameter in HTTP


        * Set the includeGridData

        URL parameter to true.  If a field mask is set, the `includeGridData`

        parameter is ignored


        For large spreadsheets, it is recommended to retrieve only the specific

        fields of the spreadsheet that you want.


        To retrieve only subsets of the spreadsheet, use the

        ranges URL parameter.

        Multiple ranges can be specified.  Limiting the range will

        return only the portions of the spreadsheet that intersect the requested

        ranges. Ranges are specified using A1 notation.

        Appends values to a spreadsheet. The input range is used to search for
        existing data and find a "table" within that range. Values will be
        appended to the next row of the table, starting with the first column of
        the table. See the
        [guide](/sheets/api/guides/values#appending_values)
        and
        [sample code](/sheets/api/samples/writing#append_values)
        for specific details of how tables are detected and data is appended.

        The caller must specify the spreadsheet ID, range, and
        a valueInputOption.  The `valueInputOption` only
        controls how the input data will be added to the sheet (column-wise or
        row-wise), it does not influence what cell the data starts being written
        to.

        Each request is validated before

        being applied. If any request is not valid then the entire request will

        fail and nothing will be applied.


        Some requests have replies to

        give you some information about how

        they are applied. The replies will mirror the requests.  For example,

        if you applied 4 updates and the 3rd one had a reply, then the

        response will have 2 empty replies, the actual reply, and another empty

        reply, in that order.


        Due to the collaborative nature of spreadsheets, it is not guaranteed that

        the spreadsheet will reflect exactly your changes after this completes,

        however it is guaranteed that the updates in the request will be

        applied together atomically. Your changes may be altered with respect to

        collaborator changes. If there are no collaborators, the spreadsheet

        should reflect your changes.

        Returns the spreadsheet at the given ID.

        The caller must specify the spreadsheet ID.


        This method differs from GetSpreadsheet in that it allows selecting

        which subsets of spreadsheet data to return by specifying a

        dataFilters parameter.

        Multiple DataFilters can be specified.  Specifying one or

        more data filters will return the portions of the spreadsheet that

        intersect ranges matched by any of the filters.


        By default, data within grids will not be returned.

        You can include grid data one of two ways:


        * Specify a field mask listing your desired fields using the `fields` URL

        parameter in HTTP


        * Set the includeGridData

        parameter to true.  If a field mask is set, the `includeGridData`

        parameter is ignored


        For large spreadsheets, it is recommended to retrieve only the specific

        fields of the spreadsheet that you want.

    Color:
      description: >-
        Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is
        designed

        for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various

        languages over compactness; for example, the fields of this representation

        can be trivially provided to the constructor of "java.awt.Color" in Java; it

        can also be trivially provided to UIColor's "+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha"

        method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into

        a CSS "rgba()" string in JavaScript, as well.


        Note: this proto does not carry information about the absolute color space

        that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB,

        DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications SHOULD assume the sRGB color

        space.


        Example (Java):

             import com.google.type.Color;

             // ...
             public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) {
               float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha()
                   ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue()
                   : 1.0;

               return new java.awt.Color(
                   protocolor.getRed(),
                   protocolor.getGreen(),
                   protocolor.getBlue(),
                   alpha);
             }

             public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) {
               float red = (float) color.getRed();
               float green = (float) color.getGreen();
               float blue = (float) color.getBlue();
               float denominator = 255.0;
               Color.Builder resultBuilder =
                   Color
                       .newBuilder()
                       .setRed(red / denominator)
                       .setGreen(green / denominator)
                       .setBlue(blue / denominator);
               int alpha = color.getAlpha();
               if (alpha != 255) {
                 result.setAlpha(
                     FloatValue
                         .newBuilder()
                         .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator)
                         .build());
               }
               return resultBuilder.build();
             }
             // ...

        Example (iOS / Obj-C):

             // ...
             static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) {
                float red = [protocolor red];

                FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha];
                float alpha = 1.0;
                if (alpha_wrapper != nil) {
                  alpha = [alpha_wrapper value];
                }
                return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha];
             }

             static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) {
                 CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha;
                 if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) {
                   return nil;
                 }
                 Color* result = [[Color alloc] init];
                 [result setRed:red];
                 [result setGreen:green];
                 [result setBlue:blue];
                 if (alpha <= 0.9999) {
                   [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)];
                 }
                 [result autorelease];
                 return result;
            }
            // ...

              pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)

            This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas

            a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This

            uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is

            possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset.

            If omitted, this color object is to be rendered as a solid color

            (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given with a value of 1.0).

    GridRange:
      description: >-
        A range on a sheet.

        All indexes are zero-based.

        Indexes are half open, e.g the start index is inclusive

        and the end index is exclusive -- [start_index, end_index).

        Missing indexes indicate the range is unbounded on that side.


        For example, if `"Sheet1"` is sheet ID 0, then:

          `Sheet1!A1:A1 == sheet_id: 0,
                          start_row_index: 0, end_row_index: 1,
                          start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 1`

          `Sheet1!A3:B4 == sheet_id: 0,
                          start_row_index: 2, end_row_index: 4,
                          start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 2`

          `Sheet1!A:B == sheet_id: 0,
                        start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 2`

          `Sheet1!A5:B == sheet_id: 0,
                         start_row_index: 4,
                         start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 2`

          `Sheet1 == sheet_id:0`

        The start index must always be less than or equal to the end index.

        If the start index equals the end index, then the range is empty.

        Empty ranges are typically not meaningful and are usually rendered in the

        UI as `#REF!`.

            the row group can list up to two values. The first value corresponds

            to a value within the first column group, and the second value

            corresponds to a value in the second column group.  If no values

            are listed, this would indicate that the row should be sorted according

            to the "Grand Total" over the column groups. If a single value is listed,

            this would correspond to using the "Total" of that bucket.

            The filters are applied before aggregating data into the pivot table.

            The map's key is the column offset of the source range that you want to

            filter, and the value is the criteria for that column.


            For example, if the source was `C10:E15`, a key of `0` will have the filter

            for column `C`, whereas the key `1` is for column `D`.

        If writing a cell with a formula, the formula's ranges will automatically

        increment for each field in the range.

        For example, if writing a cell with formula `=A1` into range B2:C4,

        B2 would be `=A1`, B3 would be `=A2`, B4 would be `=A3`,

        C2 would be `=B1`, C3 would be `=B2`, C4 would be `=B3`.


        To keep the formula's ranges static, use the `$` indicator.

        For example, use the formula `=$A$1` to prevent both the row and the

        column from incrementing.
