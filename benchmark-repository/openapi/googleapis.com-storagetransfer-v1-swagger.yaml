    HttpData:
      description: >-
        An HttpData resource specifies a list of objects on the web to be
        transferred

        over HTTP.  The information of the objects to be transferred is contained in

        a file referenced by a URL. The first line in the file must be

        "TsvHttpData-1.0", which specifies the format of the file.  Subsequent lines

        specify the information of the list of objects, one object per list entry.

        Each entry has the following tab-delimited fields:


        * HTTP URL - The location of the object.


        * Length - The size of the object in bytes.


        * MD5 - The base64-encoded MD5 hash of the object.


        For an example of a valid TSV file, see

        [Transferring data from

        URLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/transfer/create-url-list).


        When transferring data based on a URL list, keep the following in mind:


        * When an object located at `http(s)://hostname:port/<URL-path>` is

        transferred to a data sink, the name of the object at the data sink is

        `<hostname>/<URL-path>`.


        * If the specified size of an object does not match the actual size of the

        object fetched, the object will not be transferred.


        * If the specified MD5 does not match the MD5 computed from the transferred

        bytes, the object transfer will fail. For more information, see

        [Generating MD5 hashes](https://cloud.google.com/storage/transfer/#md5)


        * Ensure that each URL you specify is publicly accessible. For

        example, in Cloud Storage you can

        [share an object publicly]

        (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get

        a link to it.


        * Storage Transfer Service obeys `robots.txt` rules and requires the source

        HTTP server to support `Range` requests and to return a `Content-Length`

        header in each response.


        * [ObjectConditions](#ObjectConditions) have no effect when filtering objects

        to transfer.

                namespace, i.e., no exclude-prefix may be a prefix of another
