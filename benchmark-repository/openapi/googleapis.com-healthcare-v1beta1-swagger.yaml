        Import resources to the FHIR store by loading data from the specified

        sources. This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using

        import semantics that ignore some FHIR store configuration options and are

        not suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into

        an empty FHIR store that is not being used by other clients. In cases

        where this method is not appropriate, consider using ExecuteBundle to

        load data.


        Every resource in the input must contain a client-supplied ID, and will be

        stored using that ID regardless of the

        enable_update_create setting on the FHIR

        store.


        The import process does not enforce referential integrity, regardless of

        the

        disable_referential_integrity

        setting on the FHIR store. This allows the import of resources with

        arbitrary interdependencies without considering grouping or ordering, but

        if the input data contains invalid references or if some resources fail to

        be imported, the FHIR store might be left in a state that violates

        referential integrity.


        If a resource with the specified ID already exists, the most recent

        version of the resource is overwritten without creating a new historical

        version, regardless of the

        disable_resource_versioning

        setting on the FHIR store. If transient failures occur during the import,

        it is possible that successfully imported resources will be overwritten

        more than once.


        The import operation is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple

        valid resources with the same ID but different contents. In that case,

        after the import completes, the store will contain exactly one resource

        with that ID but there is no ordering guarantee on which version of the

        contents it will have. The operation result counters do not count

        duplicate IDs as an error and will count one success for each resource in

        the input, which might result in a success count larger than the number

        of resources in the FHIR store. This often occurs when importing data

        organized in bundles produced by Patient-everything

        where each bundle contains its own copy of a resource such as Practitioner

        that might be referred to by many patients.


        If some resources fail to import, for example due to parsing errors,

        successfully imported resources are not rolled back.


        The location and format of the input data is specified by the parameters

        below. Note that if no format is specified, this method assumes the

        `BUNDLE` format. When using the `BUNDLE` format this method ignores the

        `Bundle.type` field, except that `history` bundles are rejected, and does

        not apply any of the bundle processing semantics for batch or transaction

        bundles. Unlike in ExecuteBundle, transaction bundles are not executed

        as a single transaction and bundle-internal references are not rewritten.

        The bundle is treated as a collection of resources to be written as

        provided in `Bundle.entry.resource`, ignoring `Bundle.entry.request`. As

        an example, this allows the import of `searchset` bundles produced by a

        FHIR search or

        Patient-everything operation.


        This method returns an Operation that can

        be used to track the status of the import by calling

        GetOperation.


        Immediate fatal errors appear in the

        error field, errors are also logged

        to Stackdriver (see [Viewing

        logs](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/stackdriver-logging)). Otherwise, when the

        operation finishes, a detailed response of type ImportResourcesResponse

        is returned in the response field.

        Implements the FHIR standard [batch/transaction

        interaction](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#transaction).


        Supports all interactions within a bundle, except search. This method

        accepts Bundles of type `batch` and `transaction`, processing them

        according to the [batch processing

        rules](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#2.21.0.17.1)

        and [transaction processing

        rules](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#2.21.0.17.2).


        The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR `Bundle` resource, and

        the request headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`.


        For a batch bundle or a successful transaction the response body will

        contain a JSON-encoded representation of a `Bundle` resource of type

        `batch-response` or `transaction-response` containing one entry for each

        entry in the request, with the outcome of processing the entry. In the

        case of an error for a transaction bundle, the response body will contain

        a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the

        error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR

        store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead.

        Implements the FHIR extended operation

        Searches for resources in the given FHIR store according to criteria

        specified as query parameters.


        Implements the FHIR standard [search

        interaction](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#search)

        using the search semantics described in the [FHIR Search

        specification](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/search.html).


        Supports three methods of search defined by the specification:


        *  `GET [base]?[parameters]` to search across all resources.

        *  `GET [base]/[type]?[parameters]` to search resources of a specified

        type.

        *  `POST [base]/[type]/_search?[parameters]` as an alternate form having

        the same semantics as the `GET` method.


        The `GET` methods do not support compartment searches. The `POST` method

        does not support `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` search parameters.


        On success, the response body will contain a JSON-encoded representation

        of a `Bundle` resource of type `searchset`, containing the results of the

        search.

        Errors generated by the FHIR store will contain a JSON-encoded

        `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the

        request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic

        GCP error might be returned instead.


        The server's capability statement, retrieved through

        capabilities, indicates what search parameters

        are supported on each FHIR resource. A list of all search parameters

        defined by the specification can be found in the [FHIR Search Parameter

        Registry](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/searchparameter-registry.html).


        Supported search modifiers: `:missing`, `:exact`, `:contains`, `:text`,

        `:in`, `:not-in`, `:above`, `:below`, `:[type]`, `:not`, and `:recurse`.


        Supported search result parameters: `_sort`, `_count`, `_include`,

        `_revinclude`, `_summary=text`, `_summary=data`, and `_elements`.


        The maximum number of search results returned defaults to 100, which can

        be overridden by the `_count` parameter up to a maximum limit of 1000. If

        there are additional results, the returned `Bundle` will contain

        pagination links.


        Resources with a total size larger than 5MB or a field count larger than

        50,000 might not be fully searchable as the server might trim its generated

        search index in those cases.


        Note: FHIR resources are indexed asynchronously, so there might be a slight

        delay between the time a resource is created or changes and when the change

        is reflected in search results.

        Creates a FHIR resource.


        Implements the FHIR standard [create

        interaction](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#create),

        which creates a new resource with a server-assigned resource ID.


        Also supports the FHIR standard [conditional create

        interaction](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#ccreate),

        specified by supplying an `If-None-Exist` header containing a FHIR search

        query. If no resources match this search query, the server processes the

        create operation as normal.


        The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR resource, and the request

        headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`.


        On success, the response body will contain a JSON-encoded representation

        of the resource as it was created on the server, including the

        server-assigned resource ID and version ID.

        Errors generated by the FHIR store will contain a JSON-encoded

        `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the

        request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic

        GCP error might be returned instead.

        Implements the FHIR standard [conditional update

        interaction](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#cond-update).


        Search terms are provided as query parameters following the same pattern as

        the search method.


        If the search criteria identify more than one match, the request will

        return a `412 Precondition Failed` error.

        If the search criteria identify zero matches, and the supplied resource

        body contains an `id`, and the FHIR store has

        enable_update_create set, creates the

        resource with the client-specified ID. If the search criteria identify zero

        matches, and the supplied resource body does not contain an `id`, the

        resource will be created with a server-assigned ID as per the

        create method.


        The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR resource, and the request

        headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`.


        On success, the response body will contain a JSON-encoded representation

        of the updated resource, including the server-assigned version ID.

        Errors generated by the FHIR store will contain a JSON-encoded

        `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the

        request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic

        GCP error might be returned instead.

        Lists all the messages in the given HL7v2 store with support for

        Note: HL7v2 messages are indexed asynchronously, so there might be a slight

        delay between the time a message is created and when it can be found

        through a filter.

            Restricts messages returned to those matching a filter. Syntax:

            https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/search/query_strings


            Fields/functions available for filtering are:


            *  `message_type`, from the MSH-9 segment. For example,

            `NOT message_type = "ADT"`.

            *  `send_date` or `sendDate`, the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in

            the dataset's time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example,

            `send_date < "2017-01-02"`.

            *  `send_time`, the timestamp when the message was sent, using the

            RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example,

            `send_time < "2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00"`.

            *  `send_facility`, the care center that the message came from, from the

            MSH-4 segment. For example, `send_facility = "ABC"`.

            *  `HL7RegExp(expr)`, which does regular expression matching of `expr`

            against the message payload using RE2 syntax

            (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax). For example,

            `HL7RegExp("^.*\|.*\|EMERG")`.

            *  `PatientId(value, type)`, which matches if the message lists a patient

            having an ID of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4

            segments. For example, `PatientId("123456", "MRN")`.

            *  `labels.x`, a string value of the label with key `x` as set using the

            Message.labels

            map. For example, `labels."priority"="high"`. The operator `:*` can be used

            to assert the existence of a label. For example, `labels."priority":*`.


            Limitations on conjunctions:


            *  Negation on the patient ID function or the labels field is not

            supported. For example, these queries are invalid:

            `NOT PatientId("123456", "MRN")`, `NOT labels."tag1":*`,

            `NOT labels."tag2"="val2"`.

            *  Conjunction of multiple patient ID functions is not supported, for

            example this query is invalid:

            `PatientId("123456", "MRN") AND PatientId("456789", "MRN")`.

            *  Conjunction of multiple labels fields is also not supported, for

            example this query is invalid: `labels."tag1":* AND labels."tag2"="val2"`.

            *  Conjunction of one patient ID function, one labels field and conditions

            on other fields is supported. For example, this query is valid:

            `PatientId("123456", "MRN") AND labels."tag1":* AND message_type = "ADT"`.

        If

        configured, the MLLP adapter listens to messages created by this method and

        sends those back to the hospital. A successful response indicates the

        message has been persisted to storage and a Cloud Pub/Sub notification has

        been sent. Sending to the hospital by the MLLP adapter happens

      description: >-
        Specifies the audit configuration for a service.

        The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what

        identities, if any, are exempted from logging.

        An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs.


        If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a specific service,

        the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types

        specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each

        AuditLogConfig are exempted.


        Example Policy with multiple AuditConfigs:

            {
              "audit_configs": [
                {
                  "service": "allServices"
                  "audit_log_configs": [
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_READ",
                      "exempted_members": [
                        "user:jose@example.com"
                      ]
                    },
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_WRITE",
                    },
                    {
                      "log_type": "ADMIN_READ",
                    }
                  ]
                },
                {
                  "service": "sampleservice.googleapis.com"
                  "audit_log_configs": [
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_READ",
                    },
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_WRITE",
                      "exempted_members": [
                        "user:aliya@example.com"
                      ]
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }

        For sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ

        logging. It also exempts jose@example.com from DATA_READ logging, and

        aliya@example.com from DATA_WRITE logging.

                }
              ]
            }

        This enables 'DATA_READ' and 'DATA_WRITE' logging, while exempting

            `.../{study_id}/{series_id}/{instance_id}[/{frame_number}].{extension}`

            The frame_number component exists only for multi-frame instances.


            Refer to the DICOM conformance statement for permissible MIME types:

            https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/dicom#wado-rs


            The following extensions are used for output files:
              application/dicom -> .dcm
              image/jpeg -> .jpg
              image/png -> .png

            If unspecified, the instances are exported in their original

            DICOM format.

        for

        payload formats that can't be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or

        an HTML page.



        This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in

        the request as well as the response.


        It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one

        wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the

        request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body.


        Example:

            message GetResourceRequest {
              // A unique request id.
              string request_id = 1;

              // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field.
              google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2;
            }

            service ResourceService {
              rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest) returns (google.api.HttpBody);
              rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody) returns
              (google.protobuf.Empty);
            }

        Example with streaming methods:

            service CaldavService {
              rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
                returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
              rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
                returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
            }

        Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are

        handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.

    Policy:
      description: >-
        Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to

        specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.



        A `Policy` consists of a list of `bindings`. A `binding` binds a list of

        `members` to a `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups,

        Google domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions

        defined by IAM.


        **JSON Example**

            {
              "bindings": [
                {
                  "role": "roles/owner",
                  "members": [
                    "user:mike@example.com",
                    "group:admins@example.com",
                    "domain:google.com",
                    "serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
                  ]
                },
                {
                  "role": "roles/viewer",
                  "members": ["user:sean@example.com"]
                }
              ]
            }

        **YAML Example**

            bindings:
            - members:
              - user:mike@example.com
              - group:admins@example.com
              - domain:google.com

            read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race

            conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and

            systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to

            ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.


            If no `etag` is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, then the existing

            policy is overwritten.

            rejected.


            Policies with any conditional bindings must specify version 3. Policies

            without any conditional bindings may specify any valid value or leave the
