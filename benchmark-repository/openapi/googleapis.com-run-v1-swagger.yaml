    AuditConfig:
      description: >-
        Specifies the audit configuration for a service.

        The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what

        identities, if any, are exempted from logging.

        An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs.


        If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a specific service,

        the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types

        specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each

        AuditLogConfig are exempted.


        Example Policy with multiple AuditConfigs:

            {
              "audit_configs": [
                {
                  "service": "allServices"
                  "audit_log_configs": [
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_READ",
                      "exempted_members": [
                        "user:jose@example.com"
                      ]
                    },
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_WRITE",
                    },
                    {
                      "log_type": "ADMIN_READ",
                    }
                  ]
                },
                {
                  "service": "sampleservice.googleapis.com"
                  "audit_log_configs": [
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_READ",
                    },
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_WRITE",
                      "exempted_members": [
                        "user:aliya@example.com"
                      ]
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }

        For sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ

        logging. It also exempts jose@example.com from DATA_READ logging, and

        aliya@example.com from DATA_WRITE logging.

                {

                }
              ]

            DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be

            deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is

            requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The

            resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists,

            and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the

            finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items,

            deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not

            be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or

            the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may

            request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by

            sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After

            that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL)

            to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the

            presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this

            timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the

            resource is fully terminated.

            If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

            used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name

            passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided

            value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated

            by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the

            server.


            If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will

            NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with

            Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the

            time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time

            indicated in the Retry-After header).

    Policy:
      description: >-
        Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to

        specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.



        A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more

        `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,

        Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of

        permissions (defined by IAM or configured by users). A `binding` can

        optionally specify a `condition`, which is a logic expression that further

        constrains the role binding based on attributes about the request and/or

        target resource.


        **JSON Example**

            {
              "bindings": [
                {
                  "role": "role/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",
                  "members": [
                    "user:mike@example.com",
                    "group:admins@example.com",
                    "domain:google.com",
                    "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
                  ]
                },
                {
                  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer",
                  "members": ["user:eve@example.com"],
                  "condition": {
                    "title": "expirable access",
                    "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020",
                    "expression": "request.time <
                    timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')",
                  }
                }
              ]
            }

        **YAML Example**

            bindings:
            - members:
              - user:mike@example.com
              - group:admins@example.com
              - domain:google.com
              - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
              role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin
            - members:
              - user:eve@example.com
              role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
              condition:
                title: expirable access
                description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020
                expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')

        etag:
          description: >-
            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help

            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.

            It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the

            read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race

            conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and

            systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to

            ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.


            If no `etag` is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, then the existing

            policy is overwritten. Due to blind-set semantics of an etag-less policy,

            'setIamPolicy' will not fail even if either of incoming or stored policy

            does not meet the version requirements.

            Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be

            rejected.


            Operations affecting conditional bindings must specify version 3. This can

            be either setting a conditional policy, modifying a conditional binding,

            or removing a conditional binding from the stored conditional policy.

            Operations on non-conditional policies may specify any valid value or

            leave the field unset.


            If no etag is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, any version

            compliance checks on the incoming and/or stored policy is skipped.

            ConfigurationName of a configuration to whose latest revision we

            is never set in Route's status, only its spec. This is mutually exclusive
