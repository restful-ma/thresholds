        following considerations in mind when using the
        <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Although you can
        customize the message headers when using the <code>SendRawEmail</code>
        operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply its own
        <code>Message-ID</code> and <code>Date</code> headers; if you passed
        these headers when creating the message, they will be overwritten by the
        values that Amazon SES provides.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are using
        sending authorization to send on behalf of another user,
        <code>SendRawEmail</code> enables you to specify the cross-account
        identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one
        of two ways: you can pass optional parameters <code>SourceArn</code>,
        <code>FromArn</code>, and/or <code>ReturnPathArn</code> to the API, or
        you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw
        email:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>X-SES-SOURCE-ARN</code> </p> </li> <li>
        <p> <code>X-SES-FROM-ARN</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>
        <code>X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN</code> </p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>Don't
        include these X-headers in the DKIM signature. Amazon SES removes these
        before it sends the email.</p> </important> <p>If you only specify the
        <code>SourceIdentityArn</code> parameter, Amazon SES sets the From and
        Return-Path addresses to the same identity that you specified.</p>

        customize the message headers when using the <code>SendRawEmail</code>
        operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply its own
        <code>Message-ID</code> and <code>Date</code> headers; if you passed
        these headers when creating the message, they will be overwritten by the
        values that Amazon SES provides.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are using
        sending authorization to send on behalf of another user,
        <code>SendRawEmail</code> enables you to specify the cross-account
        identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one
        of two ways: you can pass optional parameters <code>SourceArn</code>,
        <code>FromArn</code>, and/or <code>ReturnPathArn</code> to the API, or
        you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw
        email:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>X-SES-SOURCE-ARN</code> </p> </li> <li>
        <p> <code>X-SES-FROM-ARN</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>
        <code>X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN</code> </p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>Don't
        include these X-headers in the DKIM signature. Amazon SES removes these
        before it sends the email.</p> </important> <p>If you only specify the
        <code>SourceIdentityArn</code> parameter, Amazon SES sets the From and
        Return-Path addresses to the same identity that you specified.</p>

        <code>Destination</code> parameter. A destination is a set of recipients

        across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields.</p> </li> <li> <p>The
        <code>Destination</code> parameter must include at least one recipient
        email address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC:
        address, or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid
        (that is, it is not in the format

        Amazon SES can't render the email because the template contains errors,
        it doesn't send the email. Additionally, because it already accepted the
        message, Amazon SES doesn't return a message stating that it was unable
        to send the email.</p> <p>For these reasons, we highly recommend that

      description: "<p>Returns a set of DKIM tokens for a domain identity.</p> <important>
        <p>When you execute the <code>VerifyDomainDkim</code> operation, the
        domain that you specify is added to the list of identities that are
        associated with your account. This is true even if you haven't already
        associated the domain with your account by using the
        <code>VerifyDomainIdentity</code> operation. However, you can't send
        email from the domain until you either successfully <a
        href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-dom\
        ains.html\">verify it</a> or you successfully <a
        href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.\
        html\">set up DKIM for it</a>.</p> </important> <p>You use the tokens
        that are generated by this operation to create CNAME records. When
        Amazon SES detects that you've added these records to the DNS
        configuration for a domain, you can start sending email from that
        domain. You can start sending email even if you haven't added the TXT
        record provided by the VerifyDomainIdentity operation to the DNS
        configuration for your domain. All email that you send from the domain
        is authenticated using DKIM.</p> <p>To create the CNAME records for DKIM
        authentication, use the following values:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Name</b>:
        <i>token</i>._domainkey.<i>example.com</i> </p> </li> <li> <p>
        <b>Type</b>: CNAME</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Value</b>:
        <i>token</i>.dkim.amazonses.com</p> </li> </ul> <p>In the preceding
        example, replace <i>token</i> with one of the tokens that are generated
        when you execute this operation. Replace <i>example.com</i> with your
        domain. Repeat this process for each token that's generated by this
        operation.</p> <p>You can execute this operation no more than once per
