            [`traceback.format_exc()`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/traceback.html#traceback.format_exc).

            * **JavaScript**: Must be the value of

            [`error.stack`](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Stack-Trace-API) as returned

            by V8.

            * **Ruby**: Must contain frames returned by

            [`Exception.backtrace`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Exception.html#method-i-backtrace).

            * **C#**: Must be the return value of

            [`Exception.ToString()`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.exception.tostring.aspx).

            * **PHP**: Must start with `PHP (Notice|Parse error|Fatal error|Warning)`

            and contain the result of

            [`(string)$exception`](http://php.net/manual/en/exception.tostring.php).

            * **Go**: Must be the return value of
