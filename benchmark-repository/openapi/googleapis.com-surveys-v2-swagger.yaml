            quoted price is at most this value. When a survey has a Screener
            (threshold) question, it must go through an incidence pricing test
            to determine the final cost per response. Typically you will have to
            make a followup call to start the survey giving the final computed
            cost per response. If the survey has no threshold_answers, setting
            this property will return an error. By specifying this property, you
            indicate the max price per response you are willing to pay in
            advance of the incidence test. If the price turns out to be lower
            than the specified value, the survey will begin immediately and you
            will be charged at the rate determined by the incidence pricing
            test. If the price turns out to be greater than the specified value
            the survey will not be started and you will instead be notified what
            price was determined by the incidence test. At that point, you must
            raise the value of this property to be greater than or equal to that
            cost before attempting to start the survey again. This will
            immediately start the survey as long the incidence test was run
            within the last 21 days. This will no longer be available after June
            2018."
