        When creating a subaccount, the current authenticated user must have the

        Sets or updates the billing account associated with a project. You
        specify

        the new billing account by setting the `billing_account_name` in the

        `ProjectBillingInfo` resource to the resource name of a billing account.

        Associating a project with an open billing account enables billing on the

        project and allows charges for resource usage. If the project already had a

        billing account, this method changes the billing account used for resource

        usage charges.


        *Note:* Incurred charges that have not yet been reported in the transaction

        history of the GCP Console might be billed to the new billing

        account, even if the charge occurred before the new billing account was

        assigned to the project.


        The current authenticated user must have ownership privileges for both the

        [project](https://cloud.google.com/docs/permissions-overview#h.bgs0oxofvnoo

        ) and the [billing

        account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-access).


        You can disable billing on the project by setting the

        `billing_account_name` field to empty. This action disassociates the

        current billing account from the project. Any billable activity of your

        in-use services will stop, and your application could stop functioning as

        expected. Any unbilled charges to date will be billed to the previously

        associated account. The current authenticated user must be either an owner

        of the project or an owner of the billing account for the project.


        Note that associating a project with a *closed* billing account will have

        much the same effect as disabling billing on the project: any paid

        resources used by the project will be shut down. Thus, unless you wish to

        disable billing, you should always call this method with the name of an

        *open* billing account.

        The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what

        identities, if any, are exempted from logging.

        An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs.


        If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a specific service,

        the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types

        specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each

        AuditLogConfig are exempted.


        Example Policy with multiple AuditConfigs:

            {
              "audit_configs": [
                {
                  "service": "allServices"
                  "audit_log_configs": [
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_READ",
                      "exempted_members": [
                        "user:jose@example.com"
                      ]
                    },
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_WRITE",
                    },
                    {
                      "log_type": "ADMIN_READ",
                    }
                  ]
                },
                {
                  "service": "sampleservice.googleapis.com"
                  "audit_log_configs": [
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_READ",
                    },
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_WRITE",
                      "exempted_members": [
                        "user:aliya@example.com"
                      ]
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }

        For sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ

        logging. It also exempts jose@example.com from DATA_READ logging, and

        aliya@example.com from DATA_WRITE logging.

    Policy:
      description: >-
        Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to

        specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.



        A `Policy` consists of a list of `bindings`. A `binding` binds a list of

        `members` to a `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups,

        Google domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions

        defined by IAM.


        **JSON Example**

            {
              "bindings": [
                {
                  "role": "roles/owner",
                  "members": [
                    "user:mike@example.com",
                    "group:admins@example.com",
                    "domain:google.com",
                    "serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
                  ]
                },
                {
                  "role": "roles/viewer",
                  "members": ["user:sean@example.com"]
                }
              ]
            }

        **YAML Example**

            bindings:
            - members:
              - user:mike@example.com
              - group:admins@example.com
              - domain:google.com
              - serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
              role: roles/owner

            It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the

            read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race

            conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and

            systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to

            ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.


            If no `etag` is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, then the existing

            policy is overwritten.
