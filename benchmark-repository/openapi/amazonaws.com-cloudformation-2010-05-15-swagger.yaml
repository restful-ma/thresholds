  title: AWS CloudFormation
  description: <fullname>AWS CloudFormation</fullname> <p>AWS CloudFormation allows you to
    create and manage AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly.
    You can use AWS CloudFormation to leverage AWS products, such as Amazon
    Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple
    Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build
    highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications without
    creating or configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure.</p> <p>With AWS
    CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and dependencies in a
    template file. The template defines a collection of resources as a single
    unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all member
    resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the
    resources for you.</p> <p>For more information about AWS CloudFormation, see
    the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation
    Product Page</a>.</p> <p>Amazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS
    products. If you need additional technical information about a specific AWS
    product, you can find the product's technical documentation at <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/">docs.aws.amazon.com</a>.</p>

            You can specify only resources that are in the
            <code>UPDATE_FAILED</code> state because a rollback failed. You
            can't specify resources that are in the <code>UPDATE_FAILED</code>

            We recommend that you <a

            de/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors-update-rollback-fail\
            ed\"> troubleshoot</a> resources before skipping them. AWS
            CloudFormation sets the status of the specified resources to
            <code>UPDATE_COMPLETE</code> and continues to roll back the stack.
            After the rollback is complete, the state of the skipped resources
            will be inconsistent with the state of the resources in the stack
            template. Before performing another stack update, you must update
            the stack or resources to be consistent with each other. If you
            don't, subsequent stack updates might fail, and the stack will
            become unrecoverable. </p> </important> <p>Specify the minimum
            number of resources required to successfully roll back your stack.
            For example, a failed resource update might cause dependent
            resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to skip
            the dependent resources. </p> <p>To skip resources that are part of
            nested stacks, use the following format:
            <code>NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID</code>. If you want to
            specify the logical ID of a stack resource (<code>Type:
            AWS::CloudFormation::Stack</code>) in the
            <code>ResourcesToSkip</code> list, then its corresponding embedded
            stack must be in one of the following states:
            <code>DELETE_IN_PROGRESS</code>, <code>DELETE_COMPLETE</code>, or
            <code>DELETE_FAILED</code>. </p> <note> <p>Don't confuse a child
            stack's name with its corresponding logical ID defined in the parent
            stack. For an example of a continue update rollback operation with
            nested stacks, see <a

                    <code>UPDATE_FAILED</code> state because a rollback failed.
                    You can't specify resources that are in the
                    <code>UPDATE_FAILED</code> state for other reasons, for
                    example, because an update was cancelled. To check why a
                    resource update failed, use the
                    <a>DescribeStackResources</a> action, and view the resource
                    status reason. </p> <important> <p>Specify this property to
                    skip rolling back resources that AWS CloudFormation can't
                    successfully roll back. We recommend that you <a
                    href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest\
                    /UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors-upda\
                    te-rollback-failed\"> troubleshoot</a> resources before
                    skipping them. AWS CloudFormation sets the status of the
                    specified resources to <code>UPDATE_COMPLETE</code> and
                    continues to roll back the stack. After the rollback is
                    complete, the state of the skipped resources will be
                    inconsistent with the state of the resources in the stack
                    template. Before performing another stack update, you must
                    update the stack or resources to be consistent with each
                    other. If you don't, subsequent stack updates might fail,
                    and the stack will become unrecoverable. </p> </important>
                    <p>Specify the minimum number of resources required to
                    successfully roll back your stack. For example, a failed
                    resource update might cause dependent resources to fail. In
                    this case, it might not be necessary to skip the dependent
                    resources. </p> <p>To skip resources that are part of nested
                    stacks, use the following format:
                    <code>NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID</code>. If you want
                    to specify the logical ID of a stack resource (<code>Type:
                    AWS::CloudFormation::Stack</code>) in the
                    <code>ResourcesToSkip</code> list, then its corresponding
                    embedded stack must be in one of the following states:
                    <code>DELETE_IN_PROGRESS</code>,
                    <code>DELETE_COMPLETE</code>, or <code>DELETE_FAILED</code>.
                    </p> <note> <p>Don't confuse a child stack's name with its
                    corresponding logical ID defined in the parent stack. For an
                    example of a continue update rollback operation with nested
                    stacks, see <a

            <p> <code>CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND</code> </p> <p>Some template
            contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this
            can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the
            way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of
            this, users typically create a change set from the processed
            template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the
            macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template
            contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack
            directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the
            resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this
            capability. This includes the <a

            <note> <p>This capacity does not apply to creating change sets, and
            specifying it when creating change sets has no effect.</p> <p>Also,
            change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you want to
            create a stack from a stack template that contains macros <i>and</i>
            nested stacks, you must create or update the stack directly from the
            template using the <a>CreateStack</a> or <a>UpdateStack</a> action,

                    template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on
                    templates; this can include simple actions like
                    find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive
                    transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users
                    typically create a change set from the processed template,
                    so that they can review the changes resulting from the
                    macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack
                    template contains one or more macros, and you choose to
                    create a stack directly from the processed template, without
                    first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you
                    must acknowledge this capability. This includes the <a

                    to creating change sets, and specifying it when creating
                    change sets has no effect.</p> <p>Also, change sets do not
                    currently support nested stacks. If you want to create a
                    stack from a stack template that contains macros <i>and</i>

            <p>Change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you want
            to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros
            <i>and</i> nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from
            the template using this capability.</p> <important> <p>You should
            only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains
            macros if you know what processing the macro performs.</p> <p>Each
            macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing
            stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update
            the function operation without AWS CloudFormation being
            notified.</p> </important> <p>For more information, see <a

                    <code>CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM</code> </p> <p>Some stack
                    templates might include resources that can affect
                    permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating
                    new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For
                    those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by
                    specifying one of these capabilities.</p> <p>The following
                    IAM resources require you to specify either the
                    <code>CAPABILITY_IAM</code> or
                    <code>CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM</code> capability.</p> <ul> <li>
                    <p>If you have IAM resources, you can specify either
                    capability. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you have IAM resources
                    with custom names, you <i>must</i> specify

                    don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS
                    CloudFormation returns an

                    template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on
                    templates; this can include simple actions like
                    find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive
                    transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users
                    typically create a change set from the processed template,
                    so that they can review the changes resulting from the
                    macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack
                    template contains one or more macros, and you choose to
                    create a stack directly from the processed template, without
                    first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you
                    must acknowledge this capability. This includes the <a
                    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html">AWS::Include</a>

                    transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS
                    CloudFormation.</p> <p>Change sets do not currently support
                    nested stacks. If you want to create a stack from a stack
                    template that contains macros <i>and</i> nested stacks, you
                    must create the stack directly from the template using this
                    capability.</p> <important> <p>You should only create stacks
                    directly from a stack template that contains macros if you
                    know what processing the macro performs.</p> <p>Each macro
                    relies on an underlying Lambda service function for
                    processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda
                    function owner can update the function operation without AWS
                    CloudFormation being notified.</p> </important> <p>For more

                    that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to
                    delete a stack with the same name. You might retry
                    <code>DeleteStack</code> requests to ensure that AWS
                    CloudFormation successfully received them.</p> <p>All events
                    triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same
                    client request token, which you can use to track operations.
                    For example, if you execute a <code>CreateStack</code>
                    operation with the token <code>token1</code>, then all the
                    <code>StackEvents</code> generated by that operation will
                    have <code>ClientRequestToken</code> set as
                    <code>token1</code>.</p> <p>In the console, stack operations
                    display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack
                    operations that are initiated from the console use the token

                    easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you
                    create a stack using the console, each stack event would be
                    assigned the same token in the following format:

      description: <p>Returns information about a stack drift detection operation. A stack
        drift detection operation detects whether a stack's actual configuration
        differs, or has <i>drifted</i>, from it's expected configuration, as
        defined in the stack template and any values specified as template
        parameters. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its
        resources have drifted. For more information on stack and resource
        drift, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html">Detecting
        Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources</a>.</p>
        <p>Use <a>DetectStackDrift</a> to initiate a stack drift detection
        operation. <code>DetectStackDrift</code> returns a
        <code>StackDriftDetectionId</code> you can use to monitor the progress
        of the operation using <code>DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus</code>.
        Once the drift detection operation has completed, use
        <a>DescribeStackResourceDrifts</a> to return drift information about the
        stack and its resources.</p>

            <p> <code>CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND</code> </p> <p>Some template
            contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this
            can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the
            way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of
            this, users typically create a change set from the processed
            template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the
            macros before actually updating the stack. If your stack template
            contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack
            directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the
            resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this
            capability. This includes the <a

            transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation.</p>
            <p>Change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you want
            to update a stack from a stack template that contains macros
            <i>and</i> nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from
            the template using this capability.</p> <important> <p>You should
            only update stacks directly from a stack template that contains
            macros if you know what processing the macro performs.</p> <p>Each
            macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing
            stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update
            the function operation without AWS CloudFormation being
            notified.</p> </important> <p>For more information, see <a

                    template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on
                    templates; this can include simple actions like
                    find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive
                    transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users
                    typically create a change set from the processed template,
                    so that they can review the changes resulting from the
                    macros before actually updating the stack. If your stack
                    template contains one or more macros, and you choose to
                    update a stack directly from the processed template, without
                    first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you
                    must acknowledge this capability. This includes the <a
                    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html">AWS::Include</a>

                    transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS
                    CloudFormation.</p> <p>Change sets do not currently support
                    nested stacks. If you want to update a stack from a stack
                    template that contains macros <i>and</i> nested stacks, you
                    must update the stack directly from the template using this
                    capability.</p> <important> <p>You should only update stacks
                    directly from a stack template that contains macros if you
                    know what processing the macro performs.</p> <p>Each macro
                    relies on an underlying Lambda service function for
                    processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda
                    function owner can update the function operation without AWS
                    CloudFormation being notified.</p> </important> <p>For more

                    instances in the specified accounts and regions. When
                    specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how AWS
                    CloudFormation sets parameter values during stack instance
                    update operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>To override the current
                    value for a parameter, include the parameter and specify its
                    value.</p> </li> <li> <p>To leave a parameter set to its
                    present value, you can do one of the following:</p> <ul>
                    <li> <p>Do not include the parameter in the list.</p> </li>
                    <li> <p>Include the parameter and specify
                    <code>UsePreviousValue</code> as <code>true</code>. (You
                    cannot specify both a value and set
                    <code>UsePreviousValue</code> to <code>true</code>.)</p>
                    </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>To set all overridden parameter
                    back to the values specified in the stack set, specify a
                    parameter list but do not include any parameters.</p> </li>
                    <li> <p>To leave all parameters set to their present values,
                    do not specify this property at all.</p> </li> </ul>
                    <p>During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden
                    for a stack instance are not updated, but retain their
                    overridden value.</p> <p>You can only override the parameter
                    <i>values</i> that are specified in the stack set; to add or
                    delete a parameter itself, use <code>UpdateStackSet</code>
                    to update the stack set template. If you add a parameter to
                    a template, before you can override the parameter value
                    specified in the stack set you must first use <a

                    to update all stack instances with the updated template and
                    parameter value specified in the stack set. Once a stack
                    instance has been updated with the new parameter, you can
                    then override the parameter value using
                    <code>UpdateStackInstances</code>.</p>

            specify a maximum number of 50 tags.</p> <p>If you specify tags for
            this parameter, those tags replace any list of tags that are

            stack set, and checks to see if you have permission to untag
            resources. If you don't have the necessary permission(s), the entire
            <code>UpdateStackSet</code> action fails with an <code>access
            denied</code> error, and the stack set is not updated.</p>

                    templates might include resources that can affect
                    permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating
                    new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For
                    those stacks sets, you must explicitly acknowledge this by
                    specifying one of these capabilities.</p> <p>The following
                    IAM resources require you to specify either the
                    <code>CAPABILITY_IAM</code> or
                    <code>CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM</code> capability.</p> <ul> <li>
                    <p>If you have IAM resources, you can specify either
                    capability. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you have IAM resources
                    with custom names, you <i>must</i> specify

                    don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS
                    CloudFormation returns an
                    <code>InsufficientCapabilities</code> error.</p> </li> </ul>
                    <p>If your stack template contains these resources, we

                    example, when creating the stack set or during a previous
                    update of the stack set.). Any tags that you don't include

                    resources. If you omit tags that are currently associated
                    with the stack set from the list of tags you specify, AWS
                    CloudFormation assumes that you want to remove those tags
                    from the stack set, and checks to see if you have permission
                    to untag resources. If you don't have the necessary

        encapsulates any requirements that must be met before CloudFormation can
        proceed with a stack set operation in that account and region.
        CloudFormation invokes the function each time a stack set operation is
        requested for that account and region; if the function returns
        <code>FAILED</code>, CloudFormation cancels the operation in that
        account and region, and sets the stack set operation result status for
