        NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding
        to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To
        override the binding, API services can add a binding such as
        `"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration.
        For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations
        collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding
        is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation.  The

        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not

        guaranteed.  If the server doesn't support this method, it returns

        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.  Clients can use

        Operations.GetOperation or

        other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the

        operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation,

        the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with

        an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1,

        corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

    AuditConfig:
      description: >-
        Specifies the audit configuration for a service.

        The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what

        identities, if any, are exempted from logging.

        An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs.


        If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a specific service,

        the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types

        specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each

        AuditLogConfig are exempted.


        Example Policy with multiple AuditConfigs:

            {
              "audit_configs": [
                {
                  "service": "allServices"
                  "audit_log_configs": [
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_READ",
                      "exempted_members": [
                        "user:foo@gmail.com"
                      ]
                    },
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_WRITE",
                    },
                    {
                      "log_type": "ADMIN_READ",
                    }
                  ]
                },
                {
                  "service": "fooservice.googleapis.com"
                  "audit_log_configs": [
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_READ",
                    },
                    {
                      "log_type": "DATA_WRITE",
                      "exempted_members": [
                        "user:bar@gmail.com"
                      ]
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }

        For fooservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ

        logging. It also exempts foo@gmail.com from DATA_READ logging, and

        bar@gmail.com from DATA_WRITE logging.

        Metric names should start with a '/', generally be lowercase-only,

        and end in "_count". Field names should not contain an initial slash.

        The actual exported metric names will have "/iam/policy" prepended.


        Field names correspond to IAM request parameters and field values are

        their respective values.


        Supported field names:
           - "authority", which is "[token]" if IAMContext.token is present,
             otherwise the value of IAMContext.authority_selector if present, and
             otherwise a representation of IAMContext.principal; or
           - "iam_principal", a representation of IAMContext.principal even if a
             token or authority selector is present; or
           - "" (empty string), resulting in a counter with no fields.

        Examples:
          counter { metric: "/debug_access_count"  field: "iam_principal" }
          ==> increment counter /iam/policy/backend_debug_access_count

    Policy:

        Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to

        specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.



        A `Policy` consists of a list of `bindings`. A `binding` binds a list of

        `members` to a `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups,

        Google domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions

        defined by IAM.


        **JSON Example**

            {
              "bindings": [
                {
                  "role": "roles/owner",
                  "members": [
                    "user:mike@example.com",
                    "group:admins@example.com",
                    "domain:google.com",
                    "serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
                  ]
                },
                {
                  "role": "roles/viewer",
                  "members": ["user:sean@example.com"]
                }
              ]
            }

        **YAML Example**

            bindings:
            - members:
              - user:mike@example.com
              - group:admins@example.com
              - domain:google.com

            read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race

            conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and

            systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to

            ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.


            If no `etag` is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, then the existing

            policy is overwritten blindly.

    Status:
      description: >-
        The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for

        different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is

        used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains

        three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.


        You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the

        [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
