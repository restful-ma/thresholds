        certificate from a pool, it is not removed from existing compute nodes

      description: Note that each task must have a unique ID. The Batch service may not
        return the results for each task in the same order the tasks were
        submitted in this request. If the server times out or the connection is
        closed during the request, the request may have been partially or fully
        processed, or not at all. In such cases, the user should re-issue the
        request. Note that it is up to the user to correctly handle failures
        when re-issuing a request. For example, you should use the same task IDs
        during a retry so that if the prior operation succeeded, the retry will
        not create extra tasks unexpectedly. If the response contains any tasks
        which failed to add, a client can retry the request. In a retry, it is
        most efficient to resubmit only tasks that failed to add, and to omit
        tasks that were successfully added on the first attempt. The maximum
        lifetime of a task from addition to completion is 7 days. If a task has
        not completed within 7 days of being added it will be terminated by the
        Batch service and left in whatever state it was in at that time.

      description: "When you request that a pool be deleted, the following actions occur:
        the pool state is set to deleting; any ongoing resize operation on the
        pool are stopped; the Batch service starts resizing the pool to zero
        nodes; any tasks running on existing nodes are terminated and requeued
        (as if a resize pool operation had been requested with the default
        requeue option); finally, the pool is removed from the system. Because
        running tasks are requeued, the user can rerun these tasks by updating
        their job to target a different pool. The tasks can then run on the new
        pool. If you want to override the requeue behavior, then you should call
        resize pool explicitly to shrink the pool to zero size before deleting
        the pool. If you call an Update, Patch or Delete API on a pool in the
        deleting state, it will fail with HTTP status code 409 with error code

    post:
      description: During an upgrade, the Batch service upgrades each compute node in the
        pool. When a compute node is chosen for upgrade, any tasks running on
        that node are removed from the node and returned to the queue to be
        rerun later (or on a different compute node). The node will be
        unavailable until the upgrade is complete. This operation results in
        temporarily reduced pool capacity as nodes are taken out of service to
        be upgraded. Although the Batch service tries to avoid upgrading all
        compute nodes at the same time, it does not guarantee to do this
        (particularly on small pools); therefore, the pool may be temporarily
        unavailable to run tasks. When this operation runs, the pool state
        changes to upgrading. When all compute nodes have finished upgrading,
        the pool state returns to active. While the upgrade is in progress, the
        pool's currentOSVersion reflects the OS version that nodes are upgrading
        from, and targetOSVersion reflects the OS version that nodes are
        upgrading to. Once the upgrade is complete, currentOSVersion is updated
        to reflect the OS version now running on all nodes. This operation can
        only be invoked on pools created with the cloudServiceConfiguration
        property.

        before nodes running Job Manager tasks). When a Job Manager task fails
        and needs to be restarted, the system tries to schedule it at the
        highest priority. If there are no idle nodes available, the system may
        terminate one of the running tasks in the pool and return it to the
        queue in order to make room for the Job Manager task to restart. Note
        that a Job Manager task in one job does not have priority over tasks in
        other jobs. Across jobs, only job level priorities are observed. For
        example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 job needs to be restarted, it
        will not displace tasks of a priority 1 job.

            the completion of the Job Manager task does not affect the job

        Preparation task, and the job ends without any further tasks of the job
        running on that compute node (and hence the Job Preparation task does
        not re-run), then the Job Release task does not run on that node. If a

            separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux. Environment variables

            any given time, if it is time to create a new job under a job
            schedule, but the previous job is still running, the Batch service
            will not create the new job until the previous job finishes. If the
            previous job does not finish within the startWindow period of the
            new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be scheduled for that
            interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify a
            jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use
            jobManagerTask, you will need an external process to monitor when
            jobs are created, add tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready
            for the next recurrence. The default is that the schedule does not
            recur: one job is created, within the startWindow after the
            doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as soon as that job
            finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a lower
            value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you
            are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad

            equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is 'due'
            in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into the next
            recurrence interval. The default is infinite. The minimum value is 1
            minute. If you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the
