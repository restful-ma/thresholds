        Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the

        NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding
        to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To
        override the binding, API services can add a binding such as
        `"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration.
        For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations
        collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding
        is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.
