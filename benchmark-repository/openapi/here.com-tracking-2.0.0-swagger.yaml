    HERE Tracking is a cloud product designed to address location tracking
    problems for a wide range of Location IoT industry verticals.


    HERE Tracking exposes a set of REST APIs and client libraries to enable location tracking and geo-fencing for a variety of device form-factors including small-footprint (small memory and processing power) devices. HERE Tracking also includes end-user applications on mobile and web to be used as reference apps to demonstrate the product capabilities.

      Manage associations between devices and other resources.

      This service is used to manage the associations between devices and
      geofences.


      HERE Tracking generates a notification when a device crosses into or out of an associated geofence.
    name: Geofence association
  - description: >
      Create and manage geofences.


      A geofence is a geographic boundary that you can define and associate with your

      devices. HERE Tracking can then notify you when a device transitions into or out

      of a geofence.
    name: Geofences

      to communicate with HERE Tracking.
    name: Ingestion
  - description: >
      Manage notification channels for a user and trigger an 'instant update' to
      a device.


      Users can opt to receive notifications whenever one of their devices transitions

      into or out of a geofence. The channel supported for notifications is webhook.


      Webhook

      ---


      Once a user has registered a URL as a webhook, that URL will receive a POST request

      every time a transition happens.


      The POST body is a JSON object that describes the transition.


      ```

      {
          "inOut": "PING_OUTSIDE_FENCE",
          "fenceId": "{ID of geofence}",
          "deviceId": "{ID of device that transitioned}",
          "timestamp": 1499258184142,
          "notificationStatus": "SENT"
      }

      ```


      Possible values for `inOut` are:

       * PING_OUTSIDE_FENCE
       * PING_IN_FENCE

       Offline
       ---

       If a device has been working offline and caching position updates, transition
       notifications aren't sent until the device is online again. Once the device is
       online, the user receives a notification for the latest transition only.

       This behavior prevents the user from receiving a batch of out-of-date notifications
       whenever their device goes back online. However, all transitions are still recorded
       in the transitions log.

      Shadows provide an effective way to manage configurations for devices that
      are only

      intermittently online.


      Shadows are stored in HERE Tracking and contain two states of a device's

      configuration: The `reported` state and the `desired` state.


      The `reported` state contains the settings that were sent when the device was last

      online.


      The `desired` state contains the settings that will be sent to the device when the

      device next comes online.


      > **IMPORTANT**

      > Devices should not communicate directly with this service but should instead send telemetry

      > to the ingestion endpoint only. This telemetry data is used to update the `reported`

      > configuration for the device.


      Ideally, applications should only write to the `desired` configuration state and

      only read from `reported` configuration state.

      This data includes a history of the device position, payload, and timestamp.

      Use this API to access current and historical data about device
      transitions.


      A transition event is created every time a device enters or exists an associated

      geofence. These events are stored in the transition log.


      This log also includes details of events where a device 'almost' crossed a geofence

      boundary. Device positions determined through GPS, WiFi or other methods have a range

      of uncertainty about them. This uncertainty is represented as a radius around the

      recorded point showing the accuracy of the position.


      These are times when the accuracy radius reported around a device interesects with

      the geofence boundary but where it is not possible to confirm what side of the

      geofence boundary the device is on. This returns those events as well as total transitions.

        You can specify a geofence as a circle or as a polygon. You can also
        assign

        a name and a description to each geofence to help identify them. If no name

        is assigned, the geofence is named using a unique ID.


        Circle

        ---


        Specify the coordinates of the center point of the circle and a radius in

        meters.


        ```json
            {
                "name": "Home"
                "definition": {

                "description": "Small area around my house."
            }
        ```


        Polygon

        ---


        Specify an array of points. A minimum of three points are required.


        *NOTE: If the points do not describe a closed polygon, the polygon is

        automatically closed between the last and first points.*


        ```json
            {
                "name": "Work"

        The device shadow contains 'reported' and 'desired' configuration states

        for a device.


        Request

        ---


        The body is a shadow object with either an update to the `desired` or

        `reported` configuration state.


        You cannot use the same request to update the `desired` and `reported`

        properties simultaneously. Instead, use separate requests for each type of

        configuration state.


        Response

        ---


        The response body is a shadow object that shows the difference between the

        `reported` and the `desired` states. It contains properties that don't

        match across the two configurations.


        The response example shows the response to the previous request example

        where the `desired` state was updated.


        If all `reported` and `desired` properties match, the response object

        contains only the trackingId and timestamp properties.

                The same request can't update properties in both reported and desired state.

                reported:

                    current system time is always used.

            If the `reported` and `desired` states match, the response object

            only contains the trackingId and timestamp properties.

        Gets the value for a single property in the given state. You can use
        JSON selectors to select values for `desired` or `reported` properties.
        You can also reference a property by name, but if the property contains
        an object, the entire object is returned rather than a distinct value.

        The JSON selector can be nested like this: `payload/time/minutes`
      responses:
        "200":
          description: |

            The content type is defined as "text/plain" or "application/json"
            depending on the type of the property.

            'string'.

        Gets all traces that were recorded within the specified time range.


        Define the range with "before" and "after" timestamps. A successful

        response contains an array of traces that were recorded after the

        first timestamp and before the second.


        Traces are returned as an array in descending order based on timestamp.


        Note:

        ---


        To ensure a fast response, always provide both `before` and `after` timestamps.


        If no values are supplied `after` defaults to 0, and `before` defaults

        to the current system time.


        The `count` and `pageToken` parameters provide pagination for results

        where a large volume of data matches the given time range.



        In this case, `count` is the number of records returned per page along with

        a `pageToken` header in the returned HTTP response. The `pageToken` indicates

        the next available page in the matching result set. To get the next page of

        records, submit `pageToken` as a query parameter in your next request. The default

        number of records per page is 1000, which is also the maximum number of

        records per page.


        In case of success, the response body contains an array of trace

        samples between the given timestamps (after <= timestamp <= before).

        This

        log also includes events when the accuracy radius of the reported position

        intersects with a geofence boundary.


        You define the range with `before` and `after` timestamps. A successful

        response contains an array of transitions that were recorded after the

        first timestamp and before the second.


        Transitions are listed in descending order based on the timestamp.


        Note:

        ---


        To ensure a fast response, always provide both `before` and `after` timestamps.


        If no values are supplied `after` defaults to 0, and `before` defaults

        to the current system time.


        The `count` and `pageToken` parameters provide pagination for results

        where a large volume of data matches the given time range.


        In this case, `count` is the number of records returned per page along with

        a `pageToken` header in the returned HTTP response. The `pageToken` indicates

        the next available page in the matching result set. To get the next page of

        records, submit `pageToken` as a query parameter in your next request. The default

        number of records per page is 1000, which is also the maximum number of

        records per page.

        If the request is set to be synchronous, the response will be

        the desired state of the device shadow. If the request is set

        to be asynchronous, the response will be empty.


        To have a position associated with a device, the request body must contain

        either a `position` or a `scan` object (see the object definitions for

        details). If both are provided, the `scan` is resolved to a `position`. The

        more accurate of the two positions (provided and resolved) is used as the

        device's position.


        If a `scan` is provided, HERE Tracking will resolve the position asynchronously

        and return the desired state. The shadow will then be updated

        immediately after responding.

    signedRequest:
      description: >
        HERE Tracking requires that you sign your requests for tokens. The
        signature method uses the OAuth 1.0 standard. For more information on
        this standard, see the [OAuth Core 1.0](https://oauth.net/core/1.0/)
        specification.


        > **Note:** You must create a new signature for each token request to HERE Tracking. Signatures can only be used once.


        Create the Signature Base String

        ---


        The first step in creating a signature is to create the signature base string. This string contains the parameters to use when generating the signature.


        *1. To begin, make sure you have the information listed in the following table.*


        | Parameter                | Description                              |

        | ------------------------ | -----------------------------------------|

        | oauth\_consumer\_key     | The device ID for which you want to generate a token. |

        | oauth\_signature\_method | Always use "HMAC-SHA256".                 |

        | oauth\_timestamp         | The number of seconds since the Unix epoch at the point the request is generated. This must be within 10 seconds of the timestamp returned by the `/v2/timestamp` endpoint. |

        | oauth\_nonce             | A unique string for this signature. The string cannot have been used in a previous signature. Each token generation request to HERE Tracking must have a unique signature, and the value in this parameter is what is used to ensure the signature is unique. |

        | oauth\_version           | Always use "1.0".                         |


        *2. Combine these values into a single string by following these steps:*

           1. URL encode every key and value.
           2. Sort the list of key-value pairs alphabetically by key.
           3. Concatenate each key/value pair, separating each with an ampersand character ("&").

        The result is a parameter string that looks like this (line breaks are added for legibility):

           ```
           oauth_consumer_key=47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2
           &oauth_nonce=LIIpk4
           &oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA256
           &oauth_timestamp=1513634609
           &oauth_version=1.0
           ```

        *3. Combine the HTTP method, base URL, and parameter string into a single string called the "base string". This will be the string from which the signature is generated. The base string is in this format:*

           ```
           POST&https://tracking.api.here.com/v2/token&<URL encoded parameter string>
           ```

           The base string consists of:

           1. The HTTP method in caps (POST) followed by an ampersand ("&")
           2. The URL of the HERE Tracking token endpoint followed by an ampersand ("&")
           3. The URL-encoded parameter string.

           For example (line breaks are added for legibility):

           ```
           POST
            &https%3A%2F%2Ftracking.api.here.com%2Fv2%2Ftoken
            &oauth_consumer_key%3D47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2%26
            oauth_nonce%3DLIIpk4%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA256%26
            oauth_timestamp%3D1513634609%26oauth_version%3D1.0
           ```

           > **Note:** The URL-encoded base string should contain exactly two ampersands ("&").

        Create the signature

        ---


        The signing key used to sign the base string is the `deviceSecret` followed by an ampersand ("&").


        Create the signature by passing the signature base string and the signing key to the `HMAC-SHA256` hashing algorithm and converting the result to a `base64` string. Then, use the signature to request a token.


        Request the token

        ---


        Make a `POST` request to this endpoint with an `Authorization` header constructed from the above parameters and the generated signature.


        Example:


        ```
            Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key="47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2",
                oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA256",
                oauth_timestamp="1513634609",
                oauth_nonce="LIIpk4",
                oauth_version="1.0",
                oauth_signature="pQ9EJX14L736B%2Br7uZl4yQlO6Xw%3D"
