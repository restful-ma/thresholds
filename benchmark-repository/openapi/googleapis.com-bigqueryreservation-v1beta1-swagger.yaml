        Deletes a assignment. No expansion will happen.

        E.g:

        organizationA contains project1 and project2. Reservation res1 exists.

        CreateAssignment was invoked previously and following assignments were

        created explicitly:
          <organizationA, res1>
          <project1, res1>
        Then deletion of <organizationA, res1> won't affect <project1, res1>. After

        deletion of <organizationA, res1>, queries from project1 will still use

        res1, while queries from project2 will use on-demand mode.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation.  The
        server

        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not

        guaranteed.  If the server doesn't support this method, it returns

        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.  Clients can use

        Operations.GetOperation or

        other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the

        operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation,

        the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with

        an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1,

        corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Moves a assignment under a new reservation. Customers can do this by

        deleting the existing assignment followed by creating another assignment

        under the new reservation, but this method provides a transactional way to

        do so, to make sure the assignee always has an associated reservation.

        Without the method customers might see some queries run on-demand which

        might be unexpected.

        Looks up assignments for a specified resource for a particular region.

        If the request is about a project:
          1) Assignments created on the project will be returned if they exist.
          2) Otherwise assignments created on the closest ancestor will be
          returned. 3) Assignments for different JobTypes will all be returned.
        Same logic applies if the request is about a folder.

        If the request is about an organization, then assignments created on the

        organization will be returned (organization doesn't have ancestors).

        Comparing to ListAssignments, there are some behavior

        differences:
          1) permission on the assignee will be verified in this API.
          2) Hierarchy lookup (project->folder->organization) happens in this API.
          3) Parent here is projects/*/locations/*, instead of
          projects/*/locations/*reservations/*.
        Wildcard "-" can be used for projects in

        SearchAssignmentsRequest.parent. Note "-" cannot be used for projects

        nor locations.

            typically

            contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.

            Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a

            long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

            The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the
            original

            method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is

            `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard

            `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other

            methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`

            is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name

            is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is

            `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

        The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for

        different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is

        used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains

        three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.


        You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the

        [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
