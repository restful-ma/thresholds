            for a LUIS app that you submitted for training. Each element in the
            response array provides training status for a model (intent or
            entity) in the LUIS app. Note: Training status is not provided for
            prebuilt entities because they are pretrained. The "modelId"
            property identifies which intent or entity the training status
            corresponds to. To get the name and type of each model, use the
            models API which has a request URL in this format:
            https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/api/v2.0/apps/{appId}/versions/{versionId}/models
            The details property for each model can contain the following
            fields: "statusId": An integer from 0 to 3 that corresponds to the
            value of the status field. "status": A string with one of the
            following values: “Success”, “UpToDate”, “InProgress”, “Fail”. If
            the status is “Fail”, the "failureReason" property provides the
            reason for failure. "exampleCount": The number of examples used for
            training. In the case of the None intent or prebuilt domain intents
            and entities, this number includes example provided internally by
            the system as well as examples you added to your LUIS app.
            "failureReason": A string that indicates the reason training
            failed.  The value "FewLabels" means that no labeled examples were
            provided for training. "trainingDateTime": A string indicating the
            time the model was last trained. The value uses the ISO 8601 format
            for representing times in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) with a
            UTC designator (“Z”), for example: "2017-08-10T01:08:34Z".'
