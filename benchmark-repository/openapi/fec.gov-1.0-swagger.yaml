    This API allows you to explore the way candidates and committees fund their
    campaigns. 

     The FEC API is a RESTful web service supporting full-text and field-specific searches on FEC data. [Bulk downloads](https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=bulk-data) are available on the current site. Information is tied to the underlying forms by file ID and image ID. Data is updated nightly. 

     There is a lot of data, but a good place to start is to use search to find interesting candidates and committees. Then, you can use their IDs to find report or line item details with the other endpoints. If you are interested in individual donors, check out contributor information in schedule_a. 

     Get an [API key here](https://api.data.gov/signup/). That will enable you to place up to 1,000 calls an hour. Each call is limited to 100 results per page. You can email questions, comments or a request to get a key for 120 calls per minute to [APIinfo@fec.gov](mailto:apiinfo@fec.gov). You can also ask questions and discuss the data in the [FEC data Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fec-data). API changes will also be added to this group in advance of the change. 

     

     The model definitions and schema are available at [/swagger](/swagger/). This is useful for making wrappers and exploring the data. 

     A few restrictions limit the way you can use FEC data. For example, you can’t use contributor lists for commercial purposes or to solicit donations. [Learn more here](https://www.fec.gov/updates/sale-or-use-contributor-information/).

      Candidate endpoints give you access to information about the people
      running for office. This information is organized by candidate_id. If
      you're unfamiliar with candidate IDs, using `/candidates/search` will help
      you locate a particular candidate. 

       Officially, a candidate is an individual seeking nomination for election to a federal office. People become candidates when they (or agents working on their behalf) raise contributions or make expenditures that exceed $5,000. 

       The candidate endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration [Form 1](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm1.pdf), for candidate information, and [Form 2](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm2.pdf), for committee information.

      Committees are entities that spend and raise money in an election. Their
      characteristics and relationships with candidates can change over time. 

       You might want to use filters or search endpoints to find the committee you're looking for. Then you can use other committee endpoints to explore information about the committee that interests you. 

       Financial information is organized by `committee_id`, so finding the committee you're interested in will lead you to more granular financial information. 

       The committee endpoints include all FEC filers, even if they aren't registered as a committee. 

       Officially, committees include the committees and organizations that file with the FEC. Several different types of organizations file financial reports with the FEC: 

       *Campaign committees authorized by particular candidates to raise and spend funds in their campaigns. Non-party committees (e.g., PACs), some of which may be sponsored by corporations, unions, trade or membership groups, etc. Political party committees at the national, state, and local levels. Groups and individuals making only independent expenditures Corporations, unions, and other organizations making internal communications* 

       The committee endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration Form 1 and Form 2.

    name: dates
  - description: >-
      Fetch key information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P
      financial reports. 

       Most committees are required to summarize their financial activity in each filing; those summaries are included in these files. Generally, committees file reports on a quarterly or monthly basis, but some must also submit a report 12 days before primary elections. Therefore, during the primary season, the period covered by this file may be different for different committees. These totals also incorporate any changes made by committees, if any report covering the period is amended. 

       Information is made available on the API as soon as it's processed. Keep in mind, complex paper filings take longer to process. 

       The financial endpoints use data from FEC [form 5](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm5.pdf), for independent expenditors; or the summary and detailed summary pages of the FEC [Form 3](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3.pdf), for House and Senate committees; [Form 3X](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf), for PACs and parties; and [Form 3P](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3p.pdf), for presidential committees.

      Schedule A records describe itemized receipts reported by a committee.
      This is where you can look for individual contributors. If you are
      interested in individual donors, `/schedules/schedule_a` will be the
      endpoint you use. 

       Once a person gives more than a total of $200, the donations of that person must be reported by committees that file F3, F3X and F3P forms. 

       Contributions $200 and under are not required to be itemized, but you can find the total amount of these small donations by looking up the "unitemized" field in the `/reports` or `/totals` endpoints. 

       When comparing the totals from reports to line items. the totals will not match unless you only look at items where `"is_individual":true` since the same transaction is in the data multiple ways to explain the way it may move though different committees as an earmark. See the `is_individual` sql function within the migrations for more details. 

       For the Schedule A aggregates, such as by_occupation and by_state, include only unique individual contributions. See below for full methodology. 

       __Methodology for determining unique, individual contributions__ 

       For receipts over $200 use FEC code line_number to identify individuals. 

       The line numbers that specify individuals that are automatically included: 

       Line number with description - 10 Contribution to Independent Expenditure-Only Committees (Super PACs), Political Committees with non-contribution accounts (Hybrid PACs) and nonfederal party "soft money" accounts (1991-2002) from a person (individual, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, labor organization, or any other organization or group of persons) - 15 Contribution to political committees (other than Super PACs and Hybrid PACs) from an individual, partnership or limited liability company - 15E Earmarked contributions to political committees (other than Super PACs and Hybrid PACs) from an individual, partnership or limited liability company - 15J Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution from an individual, partnership or limited liability company given to joint fundraising committee - 18J | Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution from a registered committee given to joint fundraising committee - 30, 30T, 31, 31T, 32 Individual party codes 

       For receipts under $200: We check the following codes and see if there is "earmark" (or a variation) in the `memo_text` description of the contribution. 

       Line number with description -11AI The itemized individual contributions from F3 schedule A -12 Nonfederal other receipt - Levin Account (Line 2) -17 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P -17A Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P -18 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P 

       Of those transactions,[under $200, and having "earmark" in the memo text OR transactions having the codes 11A, 12, 17, 17A, or 18], we then want to exclude earmarks.

  - description: Schedule B filings describe itemized disbursements. This data explains how
      committees and other filers spend their money. These figures are reported

      Schedule E covers the line item expenditures for independent expenditures.
      For example, if a super PAC bought ads on TV to oppose a federal
      candidate, each ad purchase would be recorded here with the expenditure
      amount, name and id of the candidate, and whether the ad supported or
      opposed the candidate. 

       An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication "expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee, or their agents, or a political party or its agents." 

       Aggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double count expenditures and the totals are more accurate. You can still find the information from 24 and 48 hour reports in `/schedule/schedule_e/`.

      Efiling endpoints provide real-time campaign finance data for electronic
      filers. 

       These endpoints are perfect for watching filings roll in when you want to know the latest information. Efiling endpoints only contain the most recent two years worth of data and don't contain the processed and coded data that you can find on the other endpoints. Those endpoints are better for in-depth analysis. 

       Senate candidates and committees are required to file by paper. Other committees who raise and spend less than $50,000 in a calendar can choose whether to file electronically or by paper. 

       DISCLAIMER: The field labels contained within this resource are subject to change.  We are attempting to succinctly label these fields while conveying clear meaning to ensure accessibility for all users.

      The agency’s monitoring process may detect potential violations through a
      review of a committee’s reports or through a Commission audit. By law, all
      enforcement cases must remain confidential until they’re closed. 

       The Commission is required by law to audit Presidential campaigns that accept public funds. In addition, the Commission audits a committee when it appears not to have met the threshold requirements for substantial compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act. The audit determines whether the committee complied with limitations, prohibitions and disclosure requirements. 

       These endpoints contain Final Audit Reports approved by the Commission since inception.

        Combines the election and reporting dates with Commission meetings, conferences, outreach, Advisory Opinions, rules, litigation dates and other

        events into one calendar.


        State filtering now applies to elections, reports and reporting periods.


        Presidential pre-primary report due dates are not shown on even years.

        Filers generally opt to file monthly rather than submit over 50 pre-primary election

        reports. All reporting deadlines are available at /reporting-dates/ for reference.


        This is [the sql function](https://github.com/fecgov/openFEC/blob/develop/data/migrations/V40__omnibus_dates.sql)

        that creates the calendar.

            the entire four years of a presidential term or six years of a senatorial term,

        This endpoint provides information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports,

        which are aggregated by two-year period. We refer to two-year periods as a `cycle`.


        The cycle is named after the even-numbered year and includes the year before it. To see

        totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle

        is the next year — for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016.


        For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.


        Parameter `full_election` is replaced by `election_full`. Please use `election_full` instead.

        stays the same. If the same person runs for another office — for example, a House

        candidate runs for a Senate office — that candidate will get a unique ID for each office.

        Each result reflects a unique FEC candidate ID. That ID is assigned to the candidate for a

        particular office sought. If a candidate runs for the same office over time, that ID

        stays the same. If the same person runs for multiple offices — for example, a House

        candidate runs for a Senate office — that candidate will get a unique ID for each office.


        The candidate endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration

        [Form 1](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm1.pdf), for candidate information, and

        [Form 2](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm2.pdf), for committees information, with additional information

        to provide context.

        Find out a candidate's characteristics over time. This is particularly useful if the

        candidate runs for the same office in different districts or you want to know more about a candidate's

        previous races.


        This information is organized by `candidate_id`, so it won't help you find a candidate

        who ran for different offices over time; candidates get a new ID for each office.

            Calculated from FEC Form 2. The cycle begins with

            an odd year and is named for its ending, even year. This cycle follows

            the traditional house election cycle and subdivides the presidential

            and Senate elections into comparable two-year blocks. To see data for

            the entire four years of a presidential term or six years of a senatorial term,

            you will need the `election_full` flag.

        Each report represents the summary information from FEC Form 3, Form 3X and Form 3P.

        These reports have key statistics that illuminate the financial status of a given committee.

        Things like cash on hand, debts owed by committee, total receipts, and total disbursements

        are especially helpful for understanding a committee's financial dealings.


        By default, this endpoint includes both amended and final versions of each report. To restrict

        to only the final versions of each report, use `is_amended=false`; to view only reports that

        have been amended, use `is_amended=true`.


        Several different reporting structures exist, depending on the type of organization that

        submits financial information. To see an example of these reporting requirements,

        look at the summary and detailed summary pages of FEC Form 3, Form 3X, and Form 3P.

         - $2000 +
        ```

        In cases where the donations are $200 or less, the results include small donations

        that are reported on Schedule A, but filers are not required to itemize those small

        donations, so we also add unitemized contributions. Unitemized contributions come

        from the summary section of the forms. It represents the total money brought in from

        donors that are not reported on Schedule A and have given $200 or less.

        This endpoint provides information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports,

        which are aggregated by two-year period. We refer to two-year periods as a `cycle`.


        The cycle is named after the even-numbered year and includes the year before it. To see

        totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle

        is the next year — for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016.


        For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.


        Parameter `full_election` is replaced by `election_full`. Please use `election_full` instead.

        Key financial data reported periodically by committees as they are reported. This feed includes summary

        information from the the House F3 reports, the presidential F3p reports and the PAC and party

        F3x reports.


        Generally, committees file reports on a quarterly or monthly basis, but

        some must also submit a report 12 days before primary elections. Therefore, during the primary

        season, the period covered by this file may be different for different committees. These totals

        also incorporate any changes made by committees, if any report covering the period is amended.


        DISCLAIMER: The field labels contained within this resource are subject to change.  We are attempting to succinctly

        label these fields while conveying clear meaning to ensure accessibility for all users.

        Look at the top-level financial information for all candidates running for the same

        office.


        Choose a 2-year cycle, and `house`, `senate` or `presidential`.


        If you are looking for a Senate seat, you will need to select the state using a two-letter

        abbreviation.


        House races require state and a two-digit district number.


        Since this endpoint reflects financial information, it will only have candidates once they file

        financial reporting forms. Query the `/candidates` endpoint to see an up to date list of all the

        candidates that filed to run for a particular seat.

        Each report represents the summary information from FEC Form 3, Form 3X and Form 3P.

        These reports have key statistics that illuminate the financial status of a given committee.

        Things like cash on hand, debts owed by committee, total receipts, and total disbursements

        are especially helpful for understanding a committee's financial dealings.


        By default, this endpoint includes both amended and final versions of each report. To restrict

        to only the final versions of each report, use `is_amended=false`; to view only reports that

        have been amended, use `is_amended=true`.


        Several different reporting structures exist, depending on the type of organization that

        submits financial information. To see an example of these reporting requirements,

        look at the summary and detailed summary pages of FEC Form 3, Form 3X, and Form 3P.

        Schedule A records describe itemized receipts reported by a committee. This is where

        you can look for individual contributors. If you are interested in

        individual donors, `/schedules/schedule_a` will be the endpoint you use.


        Once a person gives more than a total of $200, the donations of that person must be

        reported by committees that file F3, F3X and F3P forms.


        Contributions $200 and under are not required to be itemized, but you can find the total

        amount of these small donations by looking up the "unitemized" field in the `/reports`

        or `/totals` endpoints.


        When comparing the totals from reports to line items. the totals will not match unless you

        only look at items where `"is_individual":true` since the same transaction is in the data

        multiple ways to explain the way it may move though different committees as an earmark.

        See the `is_individual` sql function within the migrations for more details.


        For the Schedule A aggregates, such as by_occupation and by_state, include only unique individual

        contributions. See below for full methodology.


        __Methodology for determining unique, individual contributions__


        For receipts over $200 use FEC code line_number to identify individuals.


        The line numbers that specify individuals that are automatically included:


        Line number with description
            - 10 Contribution to Independent Expenditure-Only Committees (Super PACs),
                 Political Committees with non-contribution accounts (Hybrid PACs)
                 and nonfederal party "soft money" accounts (1991-2002)
                 from a person (individual, partnership, limited liability company,
                 corporation, labor organization, or any other organization or
                 group of persons)
            - 15 Contribution to political committees (other than Super PACs
                 and Hybrid PACs) from an individual, partnership or
                 limited liability company
            - 15E Earmarked contributions to political committees
                  (other than Super PACs and Hybrid PACs) from an individual,
                  partnership or limited liability company
            - 15J Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution
                  from an individual, partnership or limited liability
                  company given to joint fundraising committee
            - 18J | Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution
                  from a registered committee given to joint fundraising committee
            - 30, 30T, 31, 31T, 32 Individual party codes

        For receipts under $200:

        We check the following codes and see if there is "earmark" (or a variation) in the `memo_text`

        description of the contribution.


        Line number with description
            -11AI The itemized individual contributions from F3 schedule A
            -12 Nonfederal other receipt - Levin Account (Line 2)
            -17 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P
            -17A Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P
            -18 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P

        Of those transactions,[under $200, and having "earmark" in the memo text OR transactions having the codes 11A, 12, 17, 17A, or 18], we then want to exclude earmarks.



        All receipt data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which

        is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results

        will default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,

        even-numbered year.


        Due to the large quantity of Schedule A filings, this endpoint is not paginated by

        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in

        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For

        example, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive a page of

        results with the following pagination information:


        ```

        pagination: {
            pages: 2152643,
            per_page: 20,
            count: 43052850,
            last_indexes: {
                last_index: "230880619",
                last_contribution_receipt_date: "2014-01-01"
            }
        }

        ```


        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and

        `last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through

        these results by using sort indices (defaults to sort by contribution date), otherwise some resources may be

        unintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these indices

        are required to properly page through this large dataset.


        Note: because the Schedule A data includes many records, counts for

        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.

            the two_year_transaction_period is named after the ending, even-numbered year. If we do not

        that are reported on Schedule A, but filers are not required to itemize those small

        donations, so we also add unitemized contributions. Unitemized contributions come

        from the summary section of the forms. It represents the total money brought in from

        donors that are not reported on Schedule A and have given $200 or less.

        Efiling endpoints provide real-time campaign finance data for electronic filers.


        These endpoints are perfect for watching filings roll in when you want to know the latest information. Efiling endpoints

        only contain the most recent two years worth of data and don't contain the processed and coded data that

        you can find on the other endpoints. Those endpoints are better for in-depth analysis.


        Senate candidates and committees are required to file by paper. Other committees who raise and spend less than $50,000

        in a calendar can choose whether to file electronically or by paper.


        DISCLAIMER: The field labels contained within this resource are subject to change.  We are attempting to succinctly

        Schedule A records describe itemized receipts reported by a committee. This is where

        you can look for individual contributors. If you are interested in

        individual donors, `/schedules/schedule_a` will be the endpoint you use.


        Once a person gives more than a total of $200, the donations of that person must be

        reported by committees that file F3, F3X and F3P forms.


        Contributions $200 and under are not required to be itemized, but you can find the total

        amount of these small donations by looking up the "unitemized" field in the `/reports`

        or `/totals` endpoints.


        When comparing the totals from reports to line items. the totals will not match unless you

        only look at items where `"is_individual":true` since the same transaction is in the data

        multiple ways to explain the way it may move though different committees as an earmark.

        See the `is_individual` sql function within the migrations for more details.


        For the Schedule A aggregates, such as by_occupation and by_state, include only unique individual

        contributions. See below for full methodology.


        __Methodology for determining unique, individual contributions__


        For receipts over $200 use FEC code line_number to identify individuals.


        The line numbers that specify individuals that are automatically included:


        Line number with description
            - 10 Contribution to Independent Expenditure-Only Committees (Super PACs),
                 Political Committees with non-contribution accounts (Hybrid PACs)
                 and nonfederal party "soft money" accounts (1991-2002)
                 from a person (individual, partnership, limited liability company,
                 corporation, labor organization, or any other organization or
                 group of persons)
            - 15 Contribution to political committees (other than Super PACs
                 and Hybrid PACs) from an individual, partnership or
                 limited liability company
            - 15E Earmarked contributions to political committees
                  (other than Super PACs and Hybrid PACs) from an individual,
                  partnership or limited liability company
            - 15J Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution
                  from an individual, partnership or limited liability
                  company given to joint fundraising committee
            - 18J | Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution
                  from a registered committee given to joint fundraising committee
            - 30, 30T, 31, 31T, 32 Individual party codes

        For receipts under $200:

        We check the following codes and see if there is "earmark" (or a variation) in the `memo_text`

        description of the contribution.


        Line number with description
            -11AI The itemized individual contributions from F3 schedule A
            -12 Nonfederal other receipt - Levin Account (Line 2)
            -17 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P
            -17A Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P
            -18 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P

        Of those transactions,[under $200, and having "earmark" in the memo text OR transactions having the codes 11A, 12, 17, 17A, or 18], we then want to exclude earmarks.



        All receipt data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which

        is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results

        will default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,

        even-numbered year.


        Due to the large quantity of Schedule A filings, this endpoint is not paginated by

        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in

        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For

        example, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive a page of

        results with the following pagination information:


        ```

        pagination: {
            pages: 2152643,
            per_page: 20,
            count: 43052850,
            last_indexes: {
                last_index: "230880619",
                last_contribution_receipt_date: "2014-01-01"
            }
        }

        ```


        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and

        `last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through

        these results by using sort indices (defaults to sort by contribution date), otherwise some resources may be

        unintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these indices

        are required to properly page through this large dataset.


        Note: because the Schedule A data includes many records, counts for

        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.

        Schedule B filings describe itemized disbursements. This data

        explains how committees and other filers spend their money. These figures are

        reported as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.


        The data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which

        is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results will

        default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,

        even-numbered year.


        Due to the large quantity of Schedule B filings, this endpoint is not paginated by

        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in

        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For

        example, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might receive a page of

        results with the following pagination information:


        ```

        pagination: {
            pages: 965191,
            per_page: 20,
            count: 19303814,
            last_indexes: {
                last_index: "230906248",
                last_disbursement_date: "2014-07-04"
            }
        }

        ```


        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230906248` and

        `last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through

        these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g. `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise

        some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance

        and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.


        Note: because the Schedule B data includes many records, counts for

        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.

        Efiling endpoints provide real-time campaign finance data for electronic filers.


        These endpoints are perfect for watching filings roll in when you want to know the latest information. Efiling endpoints

        only contain the most recent two years worth of data and don't contain the processed and coded data that

        you can find on the other endpoints. Those endpoints are better for in-depth analysis.


        Senate candidates and committees are required to file by paper. Other committees who raise and spend less than $50,000

        in a calendar can choose whether to file electronically or by paper.

        Schedule B filings describe itemized disbursements. This data

        explains how committees and other filers spend their money. These figures are

        reported as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.


        The data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which

        is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results will

        default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,

        even-numbered year.


        Due to the large quantity of Schedule B filings, this endpoint is not paginated by

        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in

        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For

        example, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might receive a page of

        results with the following pagination information:


        ```

        pagination: {
            pages: 965191,
            per_page: 20,
            count: 19303814,
            last_indexes: {
                last_index: "230906248",
                last_disbursement_date: "2014-07-04"
            }
        }

        ```


        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230906248` and

        `last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through

        these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g. `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise

        some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance

        and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.


        Note: because the Schedule B data includes many records, counts for

        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.

        Schedule E covers the line item expenditures for independent expenditures. For example, if a super PAC

        bought ads on TV to oppose a federal candidate, each ad purchase would be recorded here with

        the expenditure amount, name and id of the candidate, and whether the ad supported or opposed the candidate.


        An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication "expressly advocating the election or

        defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with,

        or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee, or their agents, or

        a political party or its agents."


        Aggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double count expenditures

        and the totals are more accurate. You can still find the information from 24 and 48 hour reports in

        `/schedule/schedule_e/`.


        Due to the large quantity of Schedule E filings, this endpoint is not paginated by

        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in

        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For

        example, when sorting by `expenditure_amount`, you might receive a page of

        results with the following pagination information:


        ```
         "pagination": {
            "count": 152623,
            "last_indexes": {
              "last_index": "3023037",
              "last_expenditure_amount": -17348.5
            },
            "per_page": 20,
            "pages": 7632
          }
        }

        ```


        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=3023037` and

        `last_expenditure_amount=` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through

        these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g. `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise

        some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance

        and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.


        Note: because the Schedule E data includes many records, counts for

        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.

        Efiling endpoints provide real-time campaign finance data for electronic filers.


        These endpoints are perfect for watching filings roll in when you want to know the latest information. Efiling endpoints

        only contain the most recent two years worth of data and don't contain the processed and coded data that

        you can find on the other endpoints. Those endpoints are better for in-depth analysis.


        Senate candidates and committees are required to file by paper. Other committees who raise and spend less than $50,000

        in a calendar can choose whether to file electronically or by paper.


        DISCLAIMER: The field labels contained within this resource are subject to change.  We are attempting to succinctly

        label these fields while conveying clear meaning to ensure accessibility for all users.

        This endpoint provides information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports,

        which are aggregated by two-year period. We refer to two-year periods as a `cycle`.


        The cycle is named after the even-numbered year and includes the year before it. To see

        totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle

        is the next year — for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016.


        For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.


        Parameter `full_election` is replaced by `election_full`. Please use `election_full` instead.

            This is a two-year period that is derived from the year a transaction took place in the

            Itemized Schedule A and Schedule B tables. In cases where we have the date of the transaction

            (contribution_receipt_date in schedules/schedule_a, disbursement_date in schedules/schedule_b)

            the two_year_transaction_period is named after the ending, even-numbered year. If we do not

            have the date  of the transaction, we fall back to using the report year (report_year in both

            tables) instead,  making the same cycle adjustment as necessary. If no transaction year is

            specified, the results default to the most current cycle.

            Itemized Schedule A and Schedule B tables. In cases where we have the date of the transaction

            (contribution_receipt_date in schedules/schedule_a, disbursement_date in schedules/schedule_b)

            the two_year_transaction_period is named after the ending, even-numbered year. If we do not

            have the date  of the transaction, we fall back to using the report year (report_year in both

            tables) instead,  making the same cycle adjustment as necessary. If no transaction year is

            specified, the results default to the most current cycle.
