        Inserts or updates the attributes of the product in a Manufacturer
        Center

        account.


        Creates a product with the provided attributes. If the product already

        exists, then all attributes are replaced with the new ones. The checks at

        upload time are minimal. All required attributes need to be present for a

        product to be valid. Issues may show up later after the API has accepted a

        new upload for a product and it is possible to overwrite an existing valid

        product with an invalid product. To detect this, you should retrieve the

        product and check it for issues once the new version is available.


        Uploaded attributes first need to be processed before they can be

        retrieved. Until then, new products will be unavailable, and retrieval

        of previously uploaded products will return the original state of the

        product.
