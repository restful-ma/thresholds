      Many of Nexmo's APIs are accessed using an API key and secret. It is
      recommended that you change or "rotate" your secrets from time to time for
      security purposes. This section provides the API interface for achieving
      this.

      Note: to work on secrets for your secondary accounts, you may authenticate with your primary credentials and supply the secondary API keys as URL parameters to these API endpoints.

        You can top up your account using this API when you have enabled
        auto-reload in the dashboard. The amount added by the top-up operation
        will be the same amount as was added in the payment when auto-reload was
        enabled.

        Your account balance is checked every 5-10 minutes and if it falls below the threshold and auto-reload is enabled, then it will be topped up automatically. Use this endpoint  if you need to top up at times when your credit may be exhausted more quickly than the auto-reload may occur.
